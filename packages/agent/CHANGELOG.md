# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [0.87.1] - 2026-09-22

## [0.87.0] - 2026-09-21

### Breaking Changes

- Removed `AgentOptions.shouldStopAfterTurn` and `AgentLoopConfig.shouldStopAfterTurn`. Use `finishTurn` and return `{ action: "end" }` to stop after the completed turn:

  ```ts
  // Before
  shouldStopAfterTurn: async (turn, signal) => await shouldStop(turn, signal),

  // After
  finishTurn: async (turn, signal) => {
    // shouldStopAfterTurn previously ran only for normal responses.
    if (turn.message.stopReason === "error" || turn.message.stopReason === "aborted") return;
    return (await shouldStop(turn, signal)) ? { action: "end" } : undefined;
  },
  ```

  `finishTurn` runs after the assistant and all tool results are finalized but before `turn_end`; its decision is applied after `turn_end`. It also runs for error and aborted responses, whose decisions are ignored because those responses remain hard exits. The guard in the migration preserves the old hook's normal-response-only invocation, including avoiding predicate side effects on hard exits. Returning `{ action: "end" }` leaves steering and follow-up queues untouched and skips `prepareNextTurn`.

### Added

- Added `prepareRequest`, which runs before every provider request, including the first. For example, return `{ context: { ...context, messages: persistedMessages } }` to install canonical context after already-selected input is emitted without introducing another queue poll.
- Added `finishTurn`, which runs after assistant/tool-result finalization and before `turn_end` for normal, error, and aborted responses. Return `{ action: "end" }` to end a normal run after `turn_end`, or `undefined` to preserve normal scheduling. `{ action: "continue" }` ensures one next provider request: existing tool-result, steering, or follow-up scheduling can satisfy that request without adding another one; otherwise the loop makes one context-only request. Error and aborted responses remain hard exits.
- Added `Agent.peekQueuedMessages()` to preview the next queue-selected batch without consuming it.

### Fixed

- Fixed harness reads misclassifying text files beginning with `GIF` as images ([#9755](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/9755)).

## [0.86.0] - 2026-09-19

## [0.85.1] - 2026-09-05

## [0.85.0] - 2026-09-04

### Fixed

- Fixed proxied assistant responses dropping persisted provider-native thinking levels.
- Fixed the write tool reporting UTF-16 code-unit counts as byte counts by removing the misleading count ([#8979](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/8979)).

## [0.84.4] - 2026-08-28

### Breaking Changes

- Changed `prepareNextTurn` and `prepareNextTurnWithContext` to run only after `shouldStopAfterTurn` and queued-message checks determine that the agent loop will start another assistant turn. They no longer run after final or terminating turns; move end-of-run work to `agent_end` handling ([#6879](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6879)).

### Fixed

- Fixed Windows `NodeExecutionEnv` aborts crashing when `taskkill.exe` is unavailable on `PATH` ([#6596](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6596)).

### Removed

- Removed the withdrawn manual-drive configuration, action inspection methods, action outcomes, and snapshot action field from `AgentHarness`.

## [0.84.3] - 2026-08-24

### Fixed

- Fixed single-object `edit` tool inputs failing validation by accepting them as one-edit arrays ([#7835](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/7835)).
- Fixed root Markdown files such as `README.md` and `AGENTS.md` in skill directories being reported as broken skills unless they declare valid skill frontmatter ([#7805](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/7805)).

## [0.84.2] - 2026-08-14

### Fixed

- Fixed `streamProxy()` dropping finalized tool-call metadata such as OpenAI Responses namespaces ([#7709](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/7709)).

## [0.84.1] - 2026-08-07

### Added

- Added `BeforeToolCallResult.terminate` so blocked tool calls can participate in the existing batch early-termination rule ([#7715](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/7715) by [@muyiyr](https://github.com/muyiyr)).

### Fixed

- Fixed `Agent.reset()` clearing transcript and runtime state during active runs; it now rejects until the agent is idle ([#7717](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/7717) by [@wesleyzhangwq](https://github.com/wesleyzhangwq)).

## [0.84.0] - 2026-08-06

### Breaking Changes

- Replaced the legacy harness session model with the v4 lane-based `Session`, `SessionStorage`, and `SessionRepo` APIs, including durable operation records, global facts, shared sequence numbers, and tree-scoped lane views.
- Promoted the v2 session and `AgentHarness` API from the experimental entrypoint to the default package export and removed the experimental subpaths.
- Removed the legacy JSONL and in-memory repository APIs. Use the v4 `JsonlSessionRepo` or `InMemorySessionRepo`, both implementing the new `SessionRepo` contract.
- Added the required `FileSystem.renameFile()` operation to harness execution environments for atomic JSONL publication; custom file-system implementations must provide same-filesystem replacement semantics ([#7707](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/7707) by [@davidbrai](https://github.com/davidbrai)).

### Added

- Added typed AI-request and harness telemetry schemas, their combined schema tuple, callback helpers, and a generated schema reference.
- Added bounded `Session.findEntriesOnBranch()` and `findEntryOnBranch()` queries with explicit traversal, filtering, ordering, and limit options.
- Added a compile-complete `AgentHarness` v2 scaffold; unfinished operation paths reject with `HarnessNotImplemented` while durable execution is implemented.
- Added `JsonlSessionRepo`, a v4 append-only JSONL session repository with metadata validation and shared storage semantics ([#7611](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/7611) by [@davidbrai](https://github.com/davidbrai)).
- Added indexed `Session.findOpenOperations()` recovery queries and `RecordQuery.operationKind` filtering ([#7646](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/7646)).
- Added `AgentOptions.shouldStopAfterTurn` for gracefully stopping after a completed turn before queued messages or another model call are processed. See [Agent Options](README.md#agent-options) ([#7367](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/7367) by [@acmerfight](https://github.com/acmerfight)).
- Added proxy forwarding for arbitrary OpenAI-compatible `samplingParams` ([#7568](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/7568) by [@mrexodia](https://github.com/mrexodia)).

### Fixed

- Fixed Windows path handling for `NodeExecutionEnv` file basenames, recursive skill loading, and prompt template names.
- Fixed `JsonlSessionRepo` enforcing session IDs globally across working directories; IDs are now unique within each working directory.
- Fixed JSONL session forks and torn-tail repairs to publish atomically, avoiding partially written or corrupted sessions after interrupted writes ([#7707](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/7707) by [@davidbrai](https://github.com/davidbrai)).

## [0.83.0] - 2026-07-29

## [0.82.1] - 2026-07-25

## [0.82.0] - 2026-07-24

### Breaking Changes

- Replaced `AgentHarness`'s `ExecutionEnv` dependency and context-free `AgentTool` inputs with application-defined `toolContext` values and context-aware `AgentHarnessTool` definitions.

### Added

- Added context-aware `read`, `write`, `edit`, and `bash` harness tools backed by `ExecutionEnv`, including async bash execution preparation.

### Changed

- Aligned harness tool path handling, edit serialization, shell output capture, explicit non-inherited environments, and cross-platform process cleanup with coding-agent behavior.

### Fixed

- Fixed compaction and branch-summary requests to use fresh routing session IDs with prompt caching disabled where supported ([#6618](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/6618) by [@tmustier](https://github.com/tmustier)).

## [0.81.1] - 2026-07-21

### Added

- Added retry policy support and lifecycle events for compaction and branch-summary operations in `AgentHarness` ([#6901](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/6901) by [@davidbrai](https://github.com/davidbrai)).

### Fixed

- Restored the `Agent` `streamFn` option and host-configurable fallback for omitted agent-loop stream functions without reintroducing a `pi-ai/compat` dependency ([#6915](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6915)).

## [0.81.0] - 2026-07-21

### Breaking Changes

- Changed `SessionStorage` to use `getPathToRootOrCompaction()`, require session name and statistics methods, support cursor-based entry reads, and store retained compaction tails as self-contained checkpoints ([#6594](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/6594) by [@cristinaponcela](https://github.com/cristinaponcela)).
- Moved the `uuidv7` export to `@earendil-works/pi-ai` ([#6834](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/6834) by [@xl0](https://github.com/xl0)).
- Replaced the optional `Agent` `streamFn` fallback with a required `streamFunction` and made low-level loop stream functions required, preventing `@earendil-works/pi-ai/compat` and all built-in providers from entering selective-provider bundles ([#6851](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6851)).

### Added

- Added usage metadata to tool results, compaction entries, and branch summaries in the agent harness ([#6671](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/6671) by [@davidbrai](https://github.com/davidbrai)).

## [0.80.10] - 2026-07-16

## [0.80.9] - 2026-07-16

## [0.80.8] - 2026-07-16

## [0.80.7] - 2026-07-14

### Added

- Added `AgentToolResult.addedToolNames` propagation to `ToolResultMessage` so tools introduced by a result can be loaded from that transcript point onward ([#6474](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/pull/6474)).

## [0.80.6] - 2026-07-09

### Added

- Added the `max` model thinking level after `xhigh`.

## [0.80.5] - 2026-07-09

## [0.80.4] - 2026-07-09

### Added

- Added configurable harness session context entry transforms and custom-entry message projectors.
- Added custom metadata support in JSONL session headers ([#6417](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/6417) by [@ArcadiaLin](https://github.com/ArcadiaLin)).
- Exported `InMemorySessionStorage` and `JsonlSessionStorage` ([#6435](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6435)).

### Fixed

- Fixed harness split-turn compaction to serialize summary requests so single-concurrency providers are not asked to run overlapping generations ([#5536](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/5536)).
- Fixed harness tool calls from length-truncated assistant messages to fail instead of waiting for missing tool results ([#6285](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/6285)).
- Fixed harness session ingestion to normalize `null` message content before context projection, avoiding crashes on lax imported transcripts ([#6343](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/6343)).
- Fixed non-positive or oversized harness shell execution timeouts to fail with a clear validation error instead of being clamped to an immediate timeout ([#6181](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6181)).
- Fixed harness session storage short entry ids to use the random tail of the generated uuidv7 instead of the timestamp prefix, which was nearly constant between calls ([#6242](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6242)).

## [0.80.3] - 2026-06-30

### Added

- Added `prepareNextTurnWithContext` for `Agent` users that need the next-turn loop context.

### Fixed

- Fixed `Agent.prepareNextTurn` to keep receiving the run abort signal instead of the next-turn context.

## [0.80.2] - 2026-06-23

### Changed

- Renamed the public harness shell execution options type from `ExecutionEnvExecOptions` to `ShellExecOptions`.

## [0.80.1] - 2026-06-23

## [0.80.0] - 2026-06-23

### Breaking Changes

- `AgentHarnessOptions.models` is required and is the only auth path: the harness streams turns, compaction, and branch summarization through the provided `Models` instance (`models.streamSimple()`/`completeSimple()`), resolving auth through the providers. `AgentHarnessOptions.getApiKeyAndHeaders` is removed — apps that resolved keys per request now express that as provider auth (`ApiKeyAuth`/`OAuthAuth`) on the providers in the `Models` collection. Build one with `createModels()` + provider factories (or `builtinModels()` from `@earendil-works/pi-ai/providers/all`); tests use `fauxProvider()`.
- `compact()`, `generateSummary()`, and `generateBranchSummary()` take a `Models` parameter and no longer accept explicit `apiKey`/`headers`.
- `StreamFn` is defined structurally (`(model, context, options?) => AssistantMessageEventStream | Promise<...>`); `Models.streamSimple` satisfies it.
- Removed the `@earendil-works/pi-agent-core/base` selective-provider entrypoint; use the root package with an explicit `Models` instance instead.

### Fixed

- Fixed harness session names to normalize newline characters before storing labels ([#5999](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/5999) by [@haoqixu](https://github.com/haoqixu)).
- Fixed harness compaction estimates to ignore malformed all-zero assistant usage after truncated responses ([#5526](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/5526) by [@dmmulroy](https://github.com/dmmulroy)).

## [0.79.10] - 2026-06-22

## [0.79.9] - 2026-06-20

### Fixed

- Fixed Node execution environment commands through legacy WSL `bash.exe` to pass scripts over stdin so shell variables expand in the target bash ([#5893](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/5893)).

## [0.79.8] - 2026-06-19

### Added

- Added `@earendil-works/pi-agent-core/base` for bundlers that want to pair the agent core with selective `@earendil-works/pi-ai/base` provider registration ([#5348](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/5348) by [@FredKSchott](https://github.com/FredKSchott)).

## [0.79.7] - 2026-06-18

## [0.79.3] - 2026-06-13

## [0.79.2] - 2026-06-12

### Fixed

- Fixed late tool progress callbacks after tool settlement to be ignored instead of emitting stale `tool_execution_update` events ([#5573](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/5573)).

## [0.79.1] - 2026-06-09

## [0.79.0] - 2026-06-08

### Fixed

- Fixed the compaction summarization system prompt to use neutral AI assistant wording for non-coding agents ([#5401](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/5401)).

## [0.78.1] - 2026-06-04

## [0.78.0] - 2026-05-29

## [0.77.0] - 2026-05-28

### Breaking Changes

- Renamed agent harness `model_select` and `thinking_level_select` events to `model_update` and `thinking_level_update`.

### Added

- Added agent harness tool registry APIs, `tools_update` events, branch-scoped active-tool persistence, and duplicate tool validation.

## [0.76.0] - 2026-05-27

### Fixed

- Fixed context token estimates to count user image attachments consistently with tool result images ([#4983](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/4983)).

## [0.75.5] - 2026-05-23

## [0.75.4] - 2026-05-20

### Changed

- Changed source syntax to avoid TypeScript constructs that require JavaScript emit, keeping the package compatible with Node.js strip-only TypeScript checks.
- Removed the package-level development watch script now that the root TypeScript check validates strip-only-compatible sources.

### Fixed

- Fixed tool-call preflight to stop preparing sibling tool calls after the run is aborted ([#4276](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/4276)).
- Fixed tail truncation for oversized single-line output that ends with a trailing newline ([#4715](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/4715)).
- Fixed Windows Node execution environment command spawns to hide helper console windows from background processes ([#4699](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/4699)).

## [0.75.3] - 2026-05-18

## [0.75.2] - 2026-05-18

## [0.75.1] - 2026-05-18

## [0.75.0] - 2026-05-17

## [0.73.0] - 2026-05-04

## [0.72.1] - 2026-05-02

### Changed

- Changed the default agent transport to `auto` so providers can use their best available transport by default ([#4083](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/4083)).

## [0.72.0] - 2026-05-01

### Added

- Added `shouldStopAfterTurn` to the low-level agent loop config for gracefully exiting after a completed turn before polling queued messages or starting another LLM call.

## [0.71.1] - 2026-05-01

## [0.71.0] - 2026-04-30

## [0.70.0] - 2026-04-23

## [0.69.0] - 2026-04-22

### Breaking Changes

- Migrated public TypeBox-facing types and examples from `@sinclair/typebox` 0.34.x to `typebox` 1.x. Install and import from `typebox` instead of relying on `@sinclair/typebox` transitively ([#3112](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3112))

### Added

- Added `terminate: true` tool-result hints to skip the automatic follow-up LLM call when every finalized tool result in the current batch opts into early termination ([#3525](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3525))

## [0.68.1] - 2026-04-22

### Fixed

- Fixed `streamProxy()` to preserve the proxy-safe serializable subset of stream options, including session, transport, retry-delay, metadata, header, cache-retention, and thinking-budget settings ([#3512](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3512))
- Fixed parallel tool execution to emit `tool_execution_end` as soon as each tool is finalized, while still emitting persisted tool-result messages in assistant source order ([#3503](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3503))

## [0.68.0] - 2026-04-20

### Changed

- Clarified parallel tool execution ordering docs to specify that final tool lifecycle and tool-result artifacts are emitted in tool completion order.

## [0.67.68] - 2026-04-17

## [0.67.67] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed

- Fixed parallel tool-call finalization to convert `afterToolCall` hook throws into error tool results instead of aborting the batch ([#3084](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3084))

## [0.67.6] - 2026-04-16

## [0.65.1] - 2026-04-05

## [0.65.0] - 2026-04-03

### Breaking Changes

- `AgentState` has been reshaped:
  - `streamMessage` was renamed to `streamingMessage`
  - `error` was renamed to `errorMessage`
  - `isStreaming`, `streamingMessage`, `pendingToolCalls`, and `errorMessage` are now readonly in the public API
  - `pendingToolCalls` is now typed as `ReadonlySet<string>`
  - `tools` and `messages` are now accessor properties, and assigning either field copies the provided top-level array instead of preserving array identity
- `AgentOptions.initialState` no longer accepts runtime-owned fields. Remove `isStreaming`, `streamingMessage`, `pendingToolCalls`, and `errorMessage` from `initialState` values.
- Removed `Agent` mutator methods in favor of direct property access:
  - `agent.setSystemPrompt(value)` -> `agent.state.systemPrompt = value`
  - `agent.setModel(model)` -> `agent.state.model = model`
  - `agent.setThinkingLevel(level)` -> `agent.state.thinkingLevel = level`
  - `agent.setTools(tools)` -> `agent.state.tools = tools`
  - `agent.replaceMessages(messages)` -> `agent.state.messages = messages`
  - `agent.appendMessage(message)` -> `agent.state.messages.push(message)`
  - `agent.clearMessages()` -> `agent.state.messages = []`
  - `agent.setToolExecution(mode)` -> `agent.toolExecution = mode`
  - `agent.setBeforeToolCall(fn)` -> `agent.beforeToolCall = fn`
  - `agent.setAfterToolCall(fn)` -> `agent.afterToolCall = fn`
  - `agent.setTransport(transport)` -> `agent.transport = transport`
- Removed queue mode getter/setter methods in favor of properties:
  - `agent.setSteeringMode(mode)` -> `agent.steeringMode = mode`
  - `agent.getSteeringMode()` -> `agent.steeringMode`
  - `agent.setFollowUpMode(mode)` -> `agent.followUpMode = mode`
  - `agent.getFollowUpMode()` -> `agent.followUpMode`
- `Agent.subscribe()` listeners are now awaited and receive the active `AbortSignal`:
  - `agent.subscribe((event) => { ... })` -> `agent.subscribe(async (event, signal) => { ... })`
  - `agent_end` is now the final emitted event for a run, but not the idle boundary
  - `agent.waitForIdle()`, `agent.prompt(...)`, and `agent.continue()` now settle only after awaited `agent_end` listeners finish
  - `agent.state.isStreaming` remains `true` until that settlement completes

## [0.64.0] - 2026-03-29

### Added

- Added `AgentTool.prepareArguments` hook to prepare raw tool call arguments before schema validation, enabling compatibility shims for resumed sessions with outdated tool schemas

## [0.63.2] - 2026-03-29

### Added

- Added `Agent.signal` to expose the active abort signal for the current turn, allowing callers to forward cancellation into nested async work ([#2660](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2660))

## [0.59.0] - 2026-03-17

## [0.58.4] - 2026-03-16

### Fixed

- Fixed steering messages to wait until the current assistant message's tool-call batch fully finishes instead of skipping pending tool calls.

## [0.58.3] - 2026-03-15

## [0.58.2] - 2026-03-15

## [0.58.1] - 2026-03-14

## [0.58.0] - 2026-03-14

### Added

- Added `beforeToolCall` and `afterToolCall` hooks to `AgentOptions` and `AgentLoopConfig` for preflight blocking and post-execution tool result mutation.

### Changed

- Added configurable tool execution mode to `Agent` and `agentLoop` via `toolExecution: "parallel" | "sequential"`, with `parallel` as the default. Parallel mode preflights tool calls sequentially, executes allowed tools concurrently, and emits final tool results in assistant source order.

### Breaking Changes

- **Queue API replaced with steer/followUp**: The `queueMessage()` method has been split into two methods with different delivery semantics ([#403](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/403)):
  - `steer(msg)`: Interrupts the agent mid-run. Delivered after current tool execution, skips remaining tools.
  - `followUp(msg)`: Waits until the agent finishes. Delivered only when there are no more tool calls or steering messages.
- **Queue mode renamed**: `queueMode` option renamed to `steeringMode`. Added new `followUpMode` option. Both control whether messages are delivered one-at-a-time or all at once.
- **AgentLoopConfig callbacks renamed**: `getQueuedMessages` split into `getSteeringMessages` and `getFollowUpMessages`.
- **Agent methods renamed**:
  - `queueMessage()` → `steer()` and `followUp()`
  - `clearMessageQueue()` → `clearSteeringQueue()`, `clearFollowUpQueue()`, `clearAllQueues()`
  - `setQueueMode()`/`getQueueMode()` → `setSteeringMode()`/`getSteeringMode()` and `setFollowUpMode()`/`getFollowUpMode()`

### Fixed

- `prompt()` and `continue()` now throw if called while the agent is already streaming, preventing race conditions and corrupted state. Use `steer()` or `followUp()` to queue messages during streaming, or `await` the previous call.

## [0.31.1] - 2026-01-02

## [0.31.0] - 2026-01-02

### Breaking Changes

- **Transport abstraction removed**: `ProviderTransport`, `AppTransport`, and `AgentTransport` interface have been removed. Use the `streamFn` option directly for custom streaming implementations.

- **Agent options renamed**:
  - `transport` → removed (use `streamFn` instead)
  - `messageTransformer` → `convertToLlm`
  - `preprocessor` → `transformContext`

- **`AppMessage` renamed to `AgentMessage`**: All references to `AppMessage` have been renamed to `AgentMessage` for consistency.

- **`CustomMessages` renamed to `CustomAgentMessages`**: The declaration merging interface has been renamed.

- **`UserMessageWithAttachments` and `Attachment` types removed**: Attachment handling is now the responsibility of the `convertToLlm` function.

- **Agent loop moved from `@mariozechner/pi-ai`**: The `agentLoop`, `agentLoopContinue`, and related types have moved to this package. Import from `@mariozechner/pi-agent-core` instead.

### Added

- `streamFn` option on `Agent` for custom stream implementations. Default uses `streamSimple` from pi-ai.

- `streamProxy()` utility function for browser apps that need to proxy LLM calls through a backend server. Replaces the removed `AppTransport`.

- `getApiKey` option for dynamic API key resolution (useful for expiring OAuth tokens like GitHub Copilot).

- `agentLoop()` and `agentLoopContinue()` low-level functions for running the agent loop without the `Agent` class wrapper.

- New exported types: `AgentLoopConfig`, `AgentContext`, `AgentTool`, `AgentToolResult`, `AgentToolUpdateCallback`, `StreamFn`.

### Changed

- `Agent` constructor now has all options optional (empty options use defaults).

- `queueMessage()` is now synchronous (no longer returns a Promise).
