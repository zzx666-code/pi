# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Breaking Changes

- Unified image models into the regular `Provider`/`Models` surface. The separate `ImagesModels` collection is removed: `createImagesModels()`, `createImagesProvider()`, `ImagesProvider`, `openrouterImagesProvider()`, `builtinImagesProviders()`, and `builtinImagesModels()` are gone. Use `builtinModels()`, `models.getModelOfType("image", ...)`, `models.generateImages()`, and `createProvider({ models, images })` instead. Existing unqualified reads remain chat-only.
- Image models are now `ImageModel` with a required `type: "image"` and share `BaseModel` with chat models. The old plural image type names (`ImagesModel`, `ImagesApi`, `KnownImagesApi`, `KnownImagesProvider`, and `ImagesProviderId`) are removed. `generateImages()` accepts only image models. Output modalities (`output`) remain on image models only.
- Generated model data schema is now version 6: every entry carries `type`, operation-specific catalogs include chat, image, and classifier models, and one upstream ID may have separate entries per type. OpenRouter image models live in the `openrouter-images` api group of `openrouter.json`; `image-models.generated.ts` and `scripts/generate-image-models.ts` are removed. Run `npm run hydrate:model-data`.

### Added

- Added `Models.generateImages()` with provider-resolved auth, `Provider.generateImages?`, and `createProvider({ images })` keyed by `model.api`. `createProvider()` `models` and `fetchModels` accept models of every type, and `api` is optional when `images` or `classifiers` is given.
- Added an optional model `type` (`"chat"`, `"image"`, or `"classifier"`). Chat models may omit it, so existing chat models, providers, and stores keep working unchanged. Narrow mixed lists with the new `isModelType()` guard or read the effective type with `getModelType()`.
- Added `getModelsOfType()`, `getModelOfType()`, `getAvailableOfType()`, `getAllModels()`, and `getAllAvailable()` on `Models`; optional `Provider.getAllModels()` and `Provider.filterAllModels()`; corresponding generated-catalog accessors; and the `AnyModel` and `ModelTypeMap` types. `hasApi()`, `calculateCost()`, and `modelsAreEqual()` accept `AnyModel`.
- Added support for models of every type in `ModelsStoreEntry.models`. Stored and fetched models of unknown types are dropped instead of failing a refresh.
- Added classifier models and `Models.classify()` with a provider-neutral JEV-style `choice`/`score`/`bool` contract. The built-in TypeSafe provider exposes models.dev's `jev-latest` through the System One API and translates public `bool` questions to TypeSafe's `noul` wire format.
- Added Jev classifier models on OpenRouter (`typesafe/jev-1.13`, `~typesafe/jev-latest`) through its TypeSafe-compatible System One endpoint, and on Cloudflare Workers AI (`typesafe/jev`) through the new `cloudflare-workers-ai-system-one` classifier API.
- Added a runtime chat-model check to the `Models` stream entry points so non-chat models fail with a clear `ModelsError` instead of a missing-api stream error.
- Added array-based `models.all.json` and `providers/{id}.all.json` variants to the generated and published JSON catalog, allowing the same upstream ID once per model type; the existing keyed `models.json` and `providers/{id}.json` stay chat-only for released clients.
- Added `onProviderStreamEvent` to observe parsed provider stream events before normalization, including provider-specific fields not retained in assistant messages ([#9784](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/9784)).

### Fixed

- Fixed 1-hour Anthropic cache writes reported by Vercel AI Gateway in streaming deltas being priced at the 5-minute rate ([#9210](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/9210)).
- Fixed model-level `samplingParams` being dropped by direct `stream()`/`complete()` calls on OpenAI-compatible APIs ([#9506](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/9506)).
- Fixed Mistral GLM models producing empty text blocks and split thinking blocks from empty content deltas, which could make later requests fail with "Expected at most one leading ThinkChunk" ([#9674](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/9674)).
- Fixed OpenAI Fast mode requests being priced at the standard rate when the response reports `service_tier: "fast"`, as GPT-6 models do ([#10034](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/10034)).

## [0.86.0] - 2026-09-19

### Breaking Changes

- Changed provider-facing `ProviderStreams` and `StreamFunction` inputs from `Context` to normalized `TranscriptContext` values.

- Fixed OpenCode and OpenCode Go requests to send `x-opencode-session` from `sessionId` across all supported API adapters ([#9326](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/9326)).
- Fixed OpenAI Codex requests to send the model's Off reasoning effort instead of omitting it, while respecting unsupported Off mappings ([#9191](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/9191)).
- Fixed Fireworks unsigned thinking replay and reasoning effort selection using catalog metadata, with verified DeepSeek V4 and Qwen3.8 fallbacks and removal of redundant GLM 5.2 and Kimi K3 effort aliases ([#9323](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/9323)).
- Fixed OpenRouter requests to send `x-session-id` from `sessionId` for Chat Completions and Anthropic Messages models when prompt caching is enabled ([#9102](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/9102)).

- Fixed fragmented Mistral tool calls splitting when continuation chunks omit the tool-call ID ([#8387](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/8387)).
- Fixed OpenAI-compatible reasoning replay to merge consecutive streamed text and summary `reasoning_details` deltas.
- Fixed the Cloudflare AI Gateway catalog to include supported `workers-ai/*` passthrough models omitted by models.dev.
- Fixed OpenRouter reasoning controls by deriving `off` support and available effort levels from OpenRouter's model metadata, preventing reasoning-mandatory models from receiving `effort: "none"` ([#8614](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/8614) by [@davidbrai](https://github.com/davidbrai)).

## [0.84.3] - 2026-08-24

- Changed the Anthropic, Azure OpenAI, Google Generative AI, Google Vertex, Mistral, OpenAI Chat Completions, and OpenAI Responses adapters to send Pi's default `User-Agent` unless overridden ([#8305](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/8305)).

### Fixed

- Fixed OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions reasoning replay to preserve and resend assistant-level `reasoning_details` (`reasoning.text`, `reasoning.summary`, and `reasoning.encrypted`) verbatim and in order ([#7994](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/7994)).
- Fixed Anthropic server-side fallback responses being priced with the requested model instead of the returned fallback model ([#8285](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/8285)).
- Fixed GitHub Copilot login triggering model-policy rate limits by limiting policy updates, retrying model discovery once, and honoring server retry delays ([#7850](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/7850)).
- Fixed Amazon Bedrock dropping and failing to replay opaque redacted reasoning from non-Anthropic models ([#8314](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/8314) by [@seiji](https://github.com/seiji)).
- Fixed Z.AI Coding Plan models deriving incomplete reasoning-effort metadata, including missing GLM-5.3 low, high, and max levels ([#8336](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/8336)).
- Fixed DeepSeek V4 Flash on OpenCode and OpenCode Go omitting its supported low thinking level ([#8181](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/8181) by [@tianshuang](https://github.com/tianshuang)).
- Fixed Azure OpenAI Responses ignoring `toolChoice` in provider-specific stream requests.
- Fixed Amazon Bedrock `after_provider_response`/`onResponse` to forward the raw response headers instead of only the synthesized request id header ([#8234](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/8234)).
- Fixed Kimi OpenAI-compatible usage reporting so top-level `cached_tokens` count as cache reads instead of normal input tokens ([#8075](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/8075)).
- Fixed Google Generative AI and Vertex AI custom models ignoring `thinkingLevelMap`, which dropped extended thinking controls ([#8135](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/8135)).
- Fixed Xiaomi model catalog generation retaining shut-down MiMo V2 model names after models.dev marked them deprecated ([#8187](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/8187)).
- Fixed OpenRouter reasoning controls by deriving `off` support and available effort levels from OpenRouter's model metadata, preventing reasoning-mandatory models from receiving `effort: "none"` ([#8454](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/8454)).

## [0.84.2] - 2026-08-14

### Added

- Added `createGatewayBindingFetch()` for routing Cloudflare AI Gateway requests through a Workers AI binding without an API token ([#7901](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/7901) by [@Maximo-Guk](https://github.com/Maximo-Guk)).
- Added `AssistantMessage.endTurn` to preserve OpenAI Codex's terminal `end_turn` signal for diagnostics ([#7766](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/7766)).

### Changed

- Changed Kimi Coding requests to use pi's runtime `User-Agent` header.
- Automatically converted supported strict tool schemas to provider-compatible closed objects with required nullable optional fields while preserving original tool definitions, and treated `null` values for optional non-nullable tool arguments as omitted.
- Changed OpenAI Responses deferred tool loading to prefer message-anchored `additional_tools` where supported while retaining tool-search and top-level fallbacks ([#7709](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/7709)).
- Replaced the Mistral SDK transport with a native Chat Completions HTTP stream, eliminating its generated client and schema runtime overhead.

### Fixed

- Fixed GitHub Copilot login triggering API rate limits while enabling model policies by limiting concurrent policy updates ([#6187](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6187)).
- Fixed GitHub Copilot login still triggering API rate limits by updating only account models with unconfigured policies and honoring server retry delays ([#7850](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/7850)).
- Fixed upstream request buffer limit failures to trigger automatic assistant retries.
- Fixed OpenAI Responses function and custom tool calls to preserve namespaces during streaming, proxying, and replay ([#7709](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/7709)).
- Fixed built-in and custom DeepSeek API models to send output limits through the supported `max_tokens` field.
- Fixed Google Generative AI and Vertex AI responses with tool calls incorrectly treating output-limit or provider-error stops as normal tool use ([#8059](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/8059)).
- Fixed Amazon Bedrock replay rejecting tool arguments that contain empty object keys while preserving all valid nested values ([#7882](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/7882) by [@muyiyr](https://github.com/muyiyr)).
- Fixed DeepSeek compatibility detection for base URLs whose hostname contains uppercase letters ([#7933](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/7933) by [@yearth](https://github.com/yearth)).

## [0.84.1] - 2026-08-07

### Added

- Added Qwen Token Plan Individual as a built-in provider with its documented subscription model catalog and the shared international `QWEN_TOKEN_PLAN_API_KEY` ([#7659](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/7659) by [@arasovic](https://github.com/arasovic)).

## [0.84.0] - 2026-08-06

### Breaking Changes

- Renamed the exported `ModelsStreamTransforms` interface to `ModelsRequestTransforms` because its header transformation now applies to all authenticated provider requests.
- Required dynamic model providers to accept a concrete `RefreshModelsContext.signal`; `Models.refresh()` remains unbounded when callers omit its optional signal.
- Required provider login, API-key check/resolution, and OAuth refresh implementations to accept a concrete abort signal; public auth and credential operations remain unbounded when callers omit their optional signal.
- Replaced raw `RefreshModelsContext.store` access with the read-only `context.stored` snapshot and generation-checked `context.publish()` transaction.

  **`createProvider({ fetchModels })`:** no catalog-publication migration is required. Before and after, return the fetched list; `createProvider()` restores stored models and publishes and persists refreshed models itself. `signal` is now guaranteed to be present.

  ```ts
  // Before
  const beforeProvider = createProvider({
    // ...
    fetchModels: async ({ signal }) => {
      const response = await fetch(catalogUrl, { signal });
      return parseModels(await response.json());
    },
  });

  // After: unchanged
  const afterProvider = createProvider({
    // ...
    fetchModels: async ({ signal }) => {
      const response = await fetch(catalogUrl, { signal });
      return parseModels(await response.json());
    },
  });
  ```

  **Handwritten `Provider.refreshModels()`:** replace direct store access and pre-publication mutation with generation-guarded publications.

  ```ts
  // Before
  refreshModels: async (context) => {
    const stored = await context.store.read();
    if (stored) currentModels = stored.models;
    if (!context.allowNetwork) return;

    const refreshed = await fetchModels(context.signal);
    currentModels = refreshed;
    await context.store.write({ models: refreshed, checkedAt: Date.now() });
  },

  // After
  refreshModels: async (context) => {
    if (context.stored) {
      const restored = context.stored.models;
      if (!(await context.publish({
        update: () => { currentModels = restored; },
      }))) return;
    }
    if (!context.allowNetwork) return;

    const refreshed = await fetchModels(context.signal);
    if (context.signal.aborted) return;
    await context.publish({
      persist: { models: refreshed, checkedAt: Date.now() },
      update: () => { currentModels = refreshed; },
    });
  },
  ```

  In `publish()`, omit `persist` to leave storage unchanged, pass a `ModelsStoreEntry` to write it, or pass `persist: null` to delete it. Omit `update` for metadata-only persistence; omit `persist` for an ephemeral in-memory publication.

### Added

- Added optional `OAuthAuth.isSubscription` metadata for distinguishing subscription-backed authentication from generic OAuth sign-in.
- Added explicit `TelemetryContext` propagation across stream, deferred, and image request options using the vendor-neutral `@earendil-works/pi-telemetry` contract.
- Added deferred provider request contracts, durable response handles, authenticated fetch/cancel dispatch, and faux-provider support for pending, ready, failed, and cancelled responses ([#7339](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/7339) by [@davidbrai](https://github.com/davidbrai)).
- Added Baseten as a built-in OpenAI-compatible provider with models.dev catalog generation and native `chat_template_args` reasoning controls.
- Added arbitrary OpenAI-compatible sampling parameters through `Model.samplingParams` and `StreamOptions.samplingParams`, including per-request overrides ([#7568](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/7568) by [@mrexodia](https://github.com/mrexodia)).
- Added opt-in vLLM `thinking_token_budget` support for OpenAI-compatible models, reserving output tokens for the final answer ([#7638](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/7638) by [@bnsd55](https://github.com/bnsd55)).
- Added `OpenAICompletionsCompat.supportsFinishReason` for providers that omit streamed `finish_reason` values, inferring normal and tool-use stops when the stream ends.
- Added structured Amazon Bedrock failure diagnostics with HTTP status, modeled error code, and AWS request id when available ([#7286](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/7286) by [@brianstanley](https://github.com/brianstanley)).

### Changed

- Added optional cancellation to `ModelsStore` reads, writes, and deletions; catalog orchestration binds these waits to the provider refresh signal.

### Fixed

- Fixed GitHub Copilot Grok 4.5 requests to use the supported Responses API ([#7560](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/7560)).
- Bounded OAuth token refreshes so stalled requests release the credential-store lock ([#7508](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/7508)).
- Fixed tool argument validation to preserve values that already match an `anyOf`/`oneOf` union arm before attempting coercion, avoiding nullable unions converting `null` to another primitive value ([#7328](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/7328)).
- Fixed cancellation of model catalog refreshes so callers stop waiting even when a custom provider ignores its abort signal ([#7027](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/7027)).
- Fixed auth resolution, availability checks, OAuth refreshes, provider login, and in-memory credential queue waits to honor caller cancellation.
- Fixed newer provider refreshes being blocked by or overwritten by an older stalled generation, including persisted catalog publication.
- Updated GPT-5.6 Terra and Luna pricing across OpenAI and passthrough model catalogs.
- Fixed Fireworks Kimi K3 models to use the OpenAI-compatible API with native reasoning-effort levels and deferred tools ([#7199](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/7199), [#7230](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/7230) by [@XBeg9](https://github.com/XBeg9)).
- Fixed Fireworks GLM 5.2 models sending the unsupported `prompt_cache_retention` field when long cache retention is enabled, and enabled session affinity for automatic prompt caching ([#7676](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/7676)).
- Updated Groq's Qwen reasoning override for the replacement `qwen/qwen3.6-27b` model.
- Fixed the OpenCode Go provider display name.
- Fixed provider error normalization treating arrays and class instances as structured response bodies instead of preserving their original errors ([#7205](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/7205) by [@erikogenvik](https://github.com/erikogenvik)).
- Fixed Anthropic streams dropping text or thinking included in the initial content-block event ([#7358](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/7358) by [@davidbrai](https://github.com/davidbrai)).
- Fixed Google history conversion dropping signed empty text and thinking blocks required for replay ([#7362](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/7362) by [@jingtao-wisdomgraph](https://github.com/jingtao-wisdomgraph)).

## [0.83.0] - 2026-07-29

### Breaking Changes

- Upgraded the exported TypeBox dependency to 1.3.7, removing deprecated APIs including `Type.Base`, `Type.Awaited`, `Type.Promise`, `Type.AsyncIterator`, `Type.Iterator`, `Type.Options`, and `Value.Mutate`, while fixing compiled validation of nullable array tool arguments. Consumers using removed APIs must migrate to supported TypeBox APIs ([#7243](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/7243) by [@petrroll](https://github.com/petrroll)).

### Added

- Added per-request `fetch` injection for supported text and image provider transports; Google adapters reject non-global implementations rather than silently bypassing them.
- Added Claude Opus 5 support for the GitHub Copilot provider, routing through the Anthropic Messages API with adaptive thinking, 1M context, and the Copilot `minimal` thinking-level override ([#7158](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/7158) by [@jay-aye-see-kay](https://github.com/jay-aye-see-kay)).
- Added the `"pending"` stop reason for partial streaming messages. See [Stop Reasons](README.md#stop-reasons) ([#7151](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/7151) by [@lucasmeijer](https://github.com/lucasmeijer)).
- Added `AssistantMessage.rawStopReason` and populated it across Google, Anthropic, Amazon Bedrock, Mistral, and OpenAI streams; unmapped terminal reasons now surface as provider errors instead of successful stops ([#7272](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/7272)).
- Added manual redirect URL and authorization-code entry to OpenRouter OAuth login for remote and headless environments ([#7114](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/7114) by [@rgarcia](https://github.com/rgarcia)).
- Added `AuthResolutionOverrides.minOAuthValidityMs` so callers can require and refresh OAuth credentials with a minimum remaining validity ([#7168](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/7168)).

### Changed

- Changed stored OAuth credentials to refresh when less than five minutes of validity remain instead of waiting until expiration ([#7168](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/7168)).

### Fixed

- Fixed Qwen Token Plan reasoning models to send their service-specific thinking controls and supported reasoning-effort levels ([#6951](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6951), [#6998](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6998)).
- Fixed Z.AI providers and compatible custom endpoints to send output limits through `max_tokens`, which those endpoints honor ([#7174](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/7174) by [@HyeokjaeLee](https://github.com/HyeokjaeLee)).
- Fixed explicitly configured Amazon Bedrock profiles being overridden by ambient AWS access keys ([#7176](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/7176) by [@christianbasch](https://github.com/christianbasch)).
- Fixed malformed OpenAI-compatible tool-call deltas with both a valid `function` payload and an empty `custom` object discarding the function arguments ([#7288](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/7288) by [@sunnyyoung](https://github.com/sunnyyoung)).

## [0.82.1] - 2026-07-25

### Added

- Added `ModelsStoreEntry.etag` so persisted provider catalogs can carry the remote ETag validator for conditional refreshes.
- Added `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` bearer authentication for Anthropic-compatible gateways ([#5871](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/5871))
- Added Claude Opus 5 support for Anthropic and Amazon Bedrock with adaptive thinking, inference profiles, prompt caching, and preserved AWS validation messages ([#7081](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/7081) by [@unexge](https://github.com/unexge), [#7083](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/7083) by [@davidbrai](https://github.com/davidbrai)).

### Changed

- Changed Radius OAuth device authorization, token exchange, and refresh requests to use the configured gateway directly.
- Changed `ModelsError` messages to append the underlying cause, so auth failures such as `OAuth refresh failed for openai-codex` report the provider response instead of a bare wrapper message.

## [0.82.0] - 2026-07-24

### Breaking Changes

- Replaced `getBuiltinModelDataUrl(provider)` with `getBuiltinModelDataGeneratedAt()` so built-in catalog freshness uses its recorded generation time instead of installation-dependent file metadata ([#7016](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/7016) by [@davidbrai](https://github.com/davidbrai)).

### Added

- Added Kimi Code subscription OAuth login for the `kimi-coding` provider, with device authorization, token refresh, and OAuth host overrides ([#6935](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/6935) by [@zaycruz](https://github.com/zaycruz)).
- Added OpenRouter OAuth PKCE login that mints a user-controlled API key for chat and image providers ([#6927](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/6927) by [@rsaryev](https://github.com/rsaryev)).
- Added `Tool.constrainedSampling` with strict JSON Schema (`prefer`/`require`) and OpenAI Lark/regex grammar variants, enforcing provider-side constrained tool sampling across OpenAI, Anthropic, Amazon Bedrock, Google Gemini, and Mistral. See [Constrained Sampling for Tools](README.md#constrained-sampling-for-tools).
- Added `supportsGrammarTools` and `supportsStrictTools` compatibility flags, expanded `supportsStrictMode` to Responses and Bedrock models, and generated model capability metadata to gate constrained sampling.

### Changed

- Changed generated model catalogs to expose only provider-verified reasoning effort levels from models.dev ([#6928](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/6928) by [@davidbrai](https://github.com/davidbrai)).

### Fixed

- Fixed OpenAI Codex cached WebSocket continuations after grammar tool calls to send only the real tool-result delta.
- Fixed constrained tool sampling across Google, Amazon Bedrock, Mistral, and Azure OpenAI Responses adapters, including model-aware strict-tool capabilities, grammar configuration validation, and malformed grammar-call replay errors.
- Fixed `cacheRetention: "none"` to disable implicit prompt-cache writes for supported OpenAI models and session-based caching for OpenAI Codex ([#6618](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/6618) by [@tmustier](https://github.com/tmustier)).
- Fixed DNS lookup failures such as `getaddrinfo`, `ENOTFOUND`, and `EAI_AGAIN` to trigger automatic assistant retries ([#6946](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/6946) by [@christianklotz](https://github.com/christianklotz)).
- Fixed OpenAI Codex WebSocket sessions to retry once without a missing previous-response continuation after `previous_response_not_found` errors ([#6955](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/6955) by [@davidbrai](https://github.com/davidbrai)).
- Fixed OpenAI and Anthropic provider retry waits to honor abort signals and configured delay limits ([#6980](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/6980) by [@petrroll](https://github.com/petrroll)).
- Fixed OpenRouter Anthropic cache breakpoints to advance through tool results and enabled cache control for `~anthropic/*-latest` aliases ([#6941](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/6941) by [@mteam88](https://github.com/mteam88)).

## [0.81.1] - 2026-07-21

### Added

- Added `retryAssistantCall()` for bounded retries of transient assistant failures with lifecycle callbacks and abort handling ([#6901](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/6901) by [@davidbrai](https://github.com/davidbrai)).

### Fixed

- Fixed Kimi K3 models from Moonshot AI and Moonshot AI China to use the OpenAI thinking format and expose reasoning effort support.

## [0.81.0] - 2026-07-21

### Added

- Added Qwen Token Plan and Qwen Token Plan China as built-in providers with regional endpoints, API-key authentication, and generated model catalogs ([#6858](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/6858) by [@QuintinShaw](https://github.com/QuintinShaw)).
- Added `contentText` for extracting joined text from message content ([#6840](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/6840) by [@xl0](https://github.com/xl0)).
- Added a shared `uuidv7` utility for time-ordered identifiers ([#6834](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/6834) by [@xl0](https://github.com/xl0)).
- Added optional usage metadata to tool result messages ([#6671](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/6671) by [@davidbrai](https://github.com/davidbrai)).

### Changed

- Changed generated model catalogs to keep TypeScript model shapes separate from ignored JSON model values, reducing generated source churn ([#6765](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/6765) by [@mitsuhiko](https://github.com/mitsuhiko)).
- Changed model generation to validate ignored provider data before compilation; `npm run build` refreshes model data as before, while `npm run build:offline` reuses existing data without network access.

### Fixed

- Fixed stored API-key credentials to apply their provider-scoped `env` values during auth resolution, including Amazon Bedrock profiles ([#6864](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/6864) by [@cristinaponcela](https://github.com/cristinaponcela)).
- Fixed OpenAI-compatible cross-provider replay to preserve unique tool call IDs when multiple calls share a provider call ID ([#6854](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/6854) by [@cristinaponcela](https://github.com/cristinaponcela)).
- Fixed Kimi K3 to expose its supported low, high, and max thinking levels, and normalized the `k2p7` alias to the canonical `kimi-for-coding` model.
- Fixed the OpenCode Go provider to support models routed through the OpenAI Responses API.
- Fixed the `pi-ai` executable path to match npm registry metadata, avoiding repeated consumer lockfile changes ([#6812](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/6812) by [@jmfederico](https://github.com/jmfederico)).
- Fixed sessionless OpenAI Codex WebSocket requests to use UUIDv7 request IDs, enabling models that reject UUIDv4 IDs ([#6834](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/6834) by [@xl0](https://github.com/xl0)).
- Fixed GitHub Copilot long-context pricing tiers in generated model metadata ([#6668](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6668)).
- Fixed Kimi Coding subscription models to report API-equivalent implied costs when models.dev reports zero pricing.
- Fixed OpenAI Responses early stream endings to be classified as retryable provider errors ([#6727](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6727)).
- Fixed GPT-5.6 Codex models to default to the 272K context window, avoiding automatic long-context pricing ([#6853](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/6853) by [@aadishv](https://github.com/aadishv)).

## [0.80.10] - 2026-07-16

### Fixed

- Fixed Kimi Coding requests to use Anthropic adaptive thinking effort without token budgets, and enabled empty thinking signatures for K3 and `kimi-for-coding`.
- Fixed Kimi K3 pricing metadata for Moonshot AI and Moonshot AI China.
- Fixed Kimi Coding K3 thinking-level metadata to expose only the supported `max` level ([#6737](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6737)).
- Fixed catalog generation restoring xAI models removed in 0.80.9 ([#6736](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6736)).

## [0.80.9] - 2026-07-16

### Added

- Added Kimi K3 support for Kimi Coding, Moonshot AI, Moonshot AI China, OpenRouter, and Vercel AI Gateway.
- Added Kimi deferred tool loading to OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions through `compat.deferredToolsMode`.

### Changed

- Changed xAI device OAuth to open a prefilled authorization link and added provider-specific OAuth login labels ([#6734](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/pull/6734) by [@Jaaneek](https://github.com/Jaaneek)).

### Fixed

- Fixed Kimi K3 output limits for Vercel AI Gateway and OpenRouter models.

### Removed

- Removed Grok 3, Grok 3 Fast, Grok 4.20 variants, and Grok Code Fast 1 from the built-in xAI model catalog ([#6734](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/pull/6734) by [@Jaaneek](https://github.com/Jaaneek)).

## [0.80.8] - 2026-07-16

### Breaking Changes

- Changed runtime authentication to provider-scoped `Models.checkAuth()`, `getAuth()`, `login()`, and `logout()` APIs. `checkAuth()` now returns `AuthCheck | undefined`, and API-key auth resolvers no longer receive a model.
- Removed the legacy built-in OAuth provider objects, global OAuth registry APIs, and public low-level built-in login/refresh functions. Use canonical `Provider.auth.oauth` methods instead; the `oauth` subpath now retains only extension compatibility types.
- Renamed the canonical login interaction interface from `AuthLoginCallbacks` to `AuthInteraction`; it exposes the provider-neutral `prompt()`/`notify()` protocol used by API-key and OAuth flows.
- Changed the `Models` request contract: `getAuth(model)` now includes model headers, while `getAuth(providerId)` remains provider-scoped, and Models stream options may include `transformHeaders`. Custom `Models` implementations must execute the transform after merging auth/model and explicit headers, then remove it before provider dispatch.
- Changed dynamic model refresh to `Models.refresh(options)`, which refreshes every configured dynamic provider and returns per-provider errors/cancellation state. `Provider.refreshModels(context)` now receives the effective credential, scoped model storage, network policy, and abort signal.

### Added

- Added provider-owned authentication and availability resolution to `Models`, including stored OAuth refresh and interactive login support through `CredentialStore`.
- Added async non-secret credential enumeration through `CredentialStore.list()` and credential-aware `Provider.filterModels()` availability policy.
- Added neutral auth-flow information/link events and provider-owned Amazon Bedrock and Google Vertex AI credential selection flows.
- Added `ModelsStore` with an in-memory default for restoring and persisting dynamic provider catalogs.
- Added the dynamic Radius `pi-messages` gateway provider with OAuth and credential-specific catalog refresh.
- Added `Models.refresh({ force: true })` to let providers bypass freshness checks for explicit refreshes.
- Added xAI device-code OAuth login and routed Grok 4.5 through OpenAI Responses, with low, medium, and high thinking support ([#6651](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/pull/6651) by [@Jaaneek](https://github.com/Jaaneek)).

### Changed

- Changed `Models.getAuth(model)` to include model headers and added a Models-only `transformHeaders` stream option that runs after auth and explicit header assembly but is not forwarded to providers.

### Fixed

- Fixed Cloudflare Workers AI and AI Gateway streams to materialize account and gateway endpoint placeholders after auth resolution, including compat streaming with custom model objects.
- Fixed lazy provider streams to preserve their final assistant message when forwarding an inner stream.
- Fixed OpenAI Codex session IDs longer than 64 characters to meet the API limit ([#6630](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/issues/6630)).

## [0.80.7] - 2026-07-14

### Breaking Changes

- Removed the `OpenAIResponsesCompat.sendSessionIdHeader` flag. Session-affinity behavior is now controlled by `compat.sessionAffinityFormat` (`"openai"`, `"openai-nosession"`, or `"openrouter"`). Replace `sendSessionIdHeader: false` with `sessionAffinityFormat: "openai-nosession"` ([#6496](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/pull/6496) by [@petrroll](https://github.com/petrroll)).

### Added

- Added cache-friendly dynamic tool loading. `ToolResultMessage.addedToolNames` marks where tools from `Context.tools` became available; Anthropic and OpenAI Responses use native deferred loading so late tools stay out of the cached prefix, while other providers continue using `Context.tools` normally ([#6474](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/pull/6474)).
- Added native `xhigh` and `max` thinking levels for Claude Fable 5 across all generated provider catalogs ([#6490](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/pull/6490) by [@davidbrai](https://github.com/davidbrai)).
- Added `toolChoice` support to OpenAI and Codex Responses, including required and named tool selection ([#6588](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/pull/6588) by [@xl0](https://github.com/xl0)).

### Fixed

- Fixed OpenRouter model context windows to use the top provider's actual context length ([#6481](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/pull/6481) by [@davidbrai](https://github.com/davidbrai)).
- Fixed the GitHub Copilot `mai-code-1-flash-picker` model to route through the `/responses` endpoint ([#6544](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/pull/6544) by [@petrroll](https://github.com/petrroll)).
- Fixed Amazon Bedrock requests to use the generic `apiKey` stream option as a Bedrock bearer token.
- Fixed OpenRouter OpenAI-compatible session IDs to use the `x-session-id` header instead of OpenAI-specific session-affinity fields ([#6496](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/pull/6496) by [@petrroll](https://github.com/petrroll)).
- Fixed Amazon Bedrock ambient AWS credentials to keep using SigV4 authentication, including for custom model IDs ([#6532](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/pull/6532) by [@ribelo](https://github.com/ribelo)).
- Fixed Cloudflare Workers AI and AI Gateway authentication to use ambient account and gateway IDs when stored credentials contain only an API key ([#6292](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/pull/6292) by [@markphelps](https://github.com/markphelps)).
- Fixed Amazon Bedrock errors to report unhandled provider stop reasons instead of only `An unknown error occurred` ([#6598](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/pull/6598) by [@davidbrai](https://github.com/davidbrai)).
- Fixed Azure OpenAI Responses reasoning replay when `encrypted_content` appears only in the terminal response event ([#6608](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/pull/6608) by [@davidbrai](https://github.com/davidbrai)).
- Fixed Anthropic-compatible proxies that omit `usage` from `message_delta` events ([#6611](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/pull/6611) by [@davidbrai](https://github.com/davidbrai)).
- Fixed OpenCode OpenAI Responses models to omit the unsupported `session-id` header while preserving other cache-affinity data ([#6645](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/pull/6645) by [@davidbrai](https://github.com/davidbrai)).

## [0.80.6] - 2026-07-09

### Added
- Added a separate opt-in `max` thinking level, including native `xhigh` and `max` support for GPT-5.6 and Anthropic adaptive-thinking effort metadata matching Anthropic's documentation: `max` on all adaptive Claude models, native `xhigh` on Opus 4.7/4.8, Sonnet 5, and Fable 5 only.
- Added request-wide input-token pricing tiers to model cost metadata and usage cost calculation.

### Fixed

- Fixed post-compaction output-token budgeting to ignore stale assistant usage from before the compaction boundary ([#6464](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6464)).
- Fixed GPT-5.4 and GPT-5.5 long-context cost accounting while retaining the intentional 272K default context limit for models that require an explicit override.
- Fixed GPT-5.6 metadata to keep direct OpenAI requests in the 272K short-context tier while exposing the Codex backend's 372K context window with long-context pricing, and removed the nonexistent bare `gpt-5.6` alias from the OpenAI and Azure OpenAI Responses catalogs.
- Fixed Anthropic message conversion to preserve thinking blocks with empty thinking text but a valid signature instead of dropping them, avoiding thinking-block errors on newer Claude models ([#6457](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/6457) by [@davidbrai](https://github.com/davidbrai)).

## [0.80.5] - 2026-07-09

## [0.80.4] - 2026-07-09

### Fixed

- Fixed retry classification for gRPC `ResourceExhausted` provider errors such as NVIDIA NIM transient exhaustion responses ([#6449](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/6449) by [@davidbrai](https://github.com/davidbrai)).
- Fixed low-level message transformation to normalize `null` message content before provider conversion, avoiding crashes on lax imported transcripts ([#6343](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/6343)).
- Fixed Xiaomi Token Plan model metadata to follow the upstream models.dev token-plan catalogs, removing unsupported `mimo-v2-omni` variants ([#6204](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6204)).
- Fixed GitHub Copilot device-code login polling to wait before the first token poll, avoiding incorrect device-code failures for some users after browser authorization ([#6187](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6187)).
- Fixed OAuth device-code polling to honor the server-provided `slow_down` interval instead of only applying the RFC 8628 5-second increment, so GitHub Copilot login recovers instead of appearing to hang when polls arrive early (e.g. WSL/VM clock drift) ([#6187](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6187)).
- Fixed OpenAI Codex user-agent construction to synchronously load Node OS metadata, avoiding a startup race that could report `pi (browser)` in Node/Bun.
- Fixed Fireworks GLM 5.2 Fast to use the OpenAI-compatible endpoint and `thinkingLevelMap`, aligning it with GLM 5.2 ([#6195](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6195)).
- Fixed Amazon Bedrock prompt-cache points for Claude Fable 5 and Claude Sonnet 5 ([#6235](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6235)).
- Fixed Amazon Bedrock Claude 5 prompt-cache pricing metadata by removing stale fallback overrides.
- Fixed DS4 server context overflow detection for `Prompt has ... tokens, but the configured context size is ... tokens` errors ([#6262](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6262)).
- Fixed OpenAI Codex WebSocket sessions to rotate cached connections before the backend's 60-minute limit, avoiding connection-limit failures on long sessions ([#6268](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6268)).
- Fixed Cloudflare Workers AI / AI Gateway auth to fall back to the ambient `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` (and `CLOUDFLARE_GATEWAY_ID`) when the stored credential carries only the API key, so `/login`-style key-only credentials no longer leave the `{CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID}` placeholder unresolved and return 404 ([#6021](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6021)).
- Fixed OpenAI Completions and Responses providers to send `(no tool output)` instead of `(see attached image)` when a tool result has empty text and no image content, preventing the model from hallucinating image attachments.
- Fixed OpenAI Responses and Azure OpenAI Responses requests to avoid sending `max_output_tokens` values below the provider minimum ([#6265](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6265)).
- Fixed retry classification for Cloudflare 524 timeout responses ([#6239](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6239)).
- Fixed retry classification for Bun fetch socket-drop errors such as `socket connection was closed`, so transient stream disconnects retry automatically ([#6431](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6431)).
- Fixed GitHub Copilot extended context window models (Claude Opus 4.7/4.8, Claude Opus 4.6, Claude Sonnet 4.6/5, Claude Fable 5, GPT-5.3 Codex, GPT-5.4, GPT-5.5) to use `contextWindow: 1000000`, preventing premature compaction and under-budgeting ([#6439](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6439)).

### Added

- Added OpenAI GPT-5.6 model metadata for `gpt-5.6`, `gpt-5.6-sol`, `gpt-5.6-terra`, and `gpt-5.6-luna`, plus verified `openai-codex` support for `gpt-5.6-sol`, `gpt-5.6-terra`, and `gpt-5.6-luna`.
- Added provider-side constrained sampling for tools via `Tool.constrainedSampling`: strict JSON-schema enforcement for OpenAI and Anthropic tool calls, and OpenAI custom grammar tools (Lark/regex). Grammar tool capability comes from the model catalog's `supportsGrammarTools` compat flag, enabled for GPT-5+ models on OpenAI, OpenAI Codex, Azure OpenAI, GitHub Copilot, opencode, and Cloudflare AI Gateway ([#6341](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/6341)).
- Refreshed generated model catalogs from models.dev, adding newly listed models including Kimi K2.7 Code for GitHub Copilot and Fable 5 to several providers ([#6256](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6256)).
- Added Claude Sonnet 5 to the GitHub Copilot model catalog ([#6200](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6200)).
- Added zstd request-body compression for the OpenAI Codex Responses SSE transport. Requests are sent with `Content-Encoding: zstd` when Node/Bun zstd support is available; the WebSocket transport is unchanged.

## [0.80.3] - 2026-06-30

### Added

- Added Anthropic Claude Sonnet 5 model metadata for Anthropic-compatible, Bedrock, OpenRouter, and Vercel AI Gateway providers.
- Added Azure OpenAI Responses support for modern Microsoft Foundry endpoint URLs ([#6004](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/6004) by [@gukoff](https://github.com/gukoff)).
- Added an optional `reasoning` field to `Usage` reporting reasoning/thinking token counts as a subset of `output`. Populated for Anthropic (`output_tokens_details.thinking_tokens`), OpenAI Responses/Codex/Azure (`output_tokens_details.reasoning_tokens`), OpenAI Completions (`completion_tokens_details.reasoning_tokens`), and Google Generative AI / Vertex (`thoughtsTokenCount`). Bedrock Converse and Mistral are not populated because those APIs do not return a reasoning token breakdown ([#6057](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6057)).

### Changed

- Changed OpenAI Codex Responses SSE response-header waits to use the configured HTTP timeout instead of the previous fixed 20 second timeout, reducing false timeouts on slow connections ([#4945](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/4945)).

### Fixed

- Fixed Claude Sonnet 5 metadata to use adaptive thinking payloads for Anthropic-compatible and Bedrock requests.
- Fixed generated Xiaomi MiMo model pricing to match current pay-as-you-go pricing from models.dev ([#6138](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6138)).
- Fixed provider HTTP errors to include response bodies instead of opaque SDK messages ([#5832](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/5832) by [@stephanmck](https://github.com/stephanmck)).
- Fixed `streamSimple()` to send a context-aware max-token cap so providers that count input and output against one context window do not reject long requests ([#5595](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/5595)).
- Fixed OpenAI Responses streams to preserve reasoning replay state when output items finish out of order ([#6009](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6009)).
- Fixed retry classification for provider errors that explicitly tell callers to retry the request ([#6019](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6019)).
- Fixed Z.AI preserved thinking requests to send `thinking.clear_thinking: false` when thinking is enabled, allowing replayed `reasoning_content` to participate in provider caching ([#6083](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6083)).

## [0.80.2] - 2026-06-23

### Changed

- Changed `ApiKeyCredential` to use the `auth.json`-compatible discriminator `type: "api_key"` and provider-scoped `env` values instead of `type: "api-key"` and metadata.

### Fixed

- Fixed Anthropic-compatible custom models to use explicit compatibility metadata instead of provider-name heuristics for session-affinity headers and unsupported tool-field omissions.
- Fixed request-scoped `apiKey` and `env` values to participate in provider auth resolution, so providers such as Cloudflare can derive request-specific base URLs from explicit call options ([#6021](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6021)).
- Restored temporary legacy per-API stream aliases such as `streamSimpleOpenAICompletions` on the compat entrypoint ([#6016](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6016), [#6017](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6017)).
- Restored runtime `detectCompat` fallback in `openai-completions` for models without explicit compat metadata ([#6020](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6020)).

## [0.80.1] - 2026-06-23

### Fixed

- Fixed a regression in Amazon Bedrock scoped `AWS_PROFILE` endpoint resolution for built-in inference profile endpoints.
- Fixed Fireworks Anthropic-compatible requests to apply session-affinity and unsupported tool-field defaults for custom Fireworks models.
- Fixed Together MiniMax M2.7 metadata to avoid unsupported Together reasoning toggles.

## [0.80.0] - 2026-06-23

### Breaking Changes

- The root entrypoint (`@earendil-works/pi-ai`) is now core-only and side-effect free. The old global API moved to the temporary `@earendil-works/pi-ai/compat` entrypoint, a strict superset of the root: switching a file's import path is the only migration step. Moved symbols include `stream`/`complete`/`streamSimple`/`completeSimple`, `getModel`/`getModels`/`getProviders` (now deprecated aliases of `getBuiltinModel`/`getBuiltinModels`/`getBuiltinProviders` from `@earendil-works/pi-ai/providers/all`), `registerApiProvider`/`unregisterApiProviders`/`resetApiProviders`/`getApiProvider`, `getEnvApiKey`/`findEnvKeys`, `setBedrockProviderModule`, the per-API lazy stream wrappers (`anthropicMessagesApi`, ...), and the image-generation API.
- Renamed the `Provider` type to `ProviderId`. `Provider` now names the runtime provider interface (id, name, auth, model listing, stream behavior).
- API implementation modules moved from `src/providers/` to `@earendil-works/pi-ai/api/*`, renamed by API id (`anthropic` -> `api/anthropic-messages`, `google` -> `api/google-generative-ai`, `mistral` -> `api/mistral-conversations`, `amazon-bedrock` -> `api/bedrock-converse-stream`), each exporting exactly `stream` and `streamSimple`. The old per-impl export names (`streamAnthropic`, `streamSimpleAnthropic`, ...) and legacy raw API subpaths (`./anthropic`, `./google`, `./openai-completions`, ...) are gone; import raw API implementations through `@earendil-works/pi-ai/api/*`.
- Removed the `@earendil-works/pi-ai/base` selective-provider entrypoint; use the root/core APIs with explicit `createModels()` collections and provider factories for isolated bundles.

Migration guide:

- Read `packages/ai/README.md` in full for the new `Models` API, provider factories, auth configuration, image generation, and custom provider examples.
- To keep the old global API temporarily, change imports from `@earendil-works/pi-ai` to `@earendil-works/pi-ai/compat`. The compat entrypoint preserves `stream`/`complete`, generated catalog reads, API registry helpers, env API-key helpers, lazy API wrappers, and image globals, but it will be removed in a future release.
- To migrate to the new runtime, create a `Models` collection and call methods on it:

  ```ts
  import { builtinModels } from "@earendil-works/pi-ai/providers/all";

  const models = builtinModels();
  const model = models.getModel("anthropic", "claude-haiku-4-5");
  if (!model) throw new Error("model not found");

  const message = await models.complete(model, {
    messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Hello", timestamp: Date.now() }],
  });
  ```

- For an isolated provider set, register provider factories explicitly:

  ```ts
  import { createModels } from "@earendil-works/pi-ai";
  import { anthropicProvider } from "@earendil-works/pi-ai/providers/anthropic";

  const models = createModels();
  models.setProvider(anthropicProvider());
  ```

- To call a raw API implementation directly, import from `@earendil-works/pi-ai/api/*` and pass a compatible model plus auth/options yourself. Raw API modules export `stream` and `streamSimple`; use `.result()` on the returned stream for `complete`/`completeSimple` behavior:

  ```ts
  import { streamSimple } from "@earendil-works/pi-ai/api/anthropic-messages";
  import { getBuiltinModel } from "@earendil-works/pi-ai/providers/all";

  const model = getBuiltinModel("anthropic", "claude-haiku-4-5");
  const stream = streamSimple(
    model,
    { messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Hello", timestamp: Date.now() }] },
    { apiKey: process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY },
  );

  const message = await stream.result();
  ```

  Custom raw models must set the matching `api` value (for example `"anthropic-messages"` for `api/anthropic-messages`) and any required provider compatibility metadata in `model.compat`.

### Added

- New `Models` runtime: `createModels()` builds an isolated provider collection with sync model reads (`getModels`/`getModel` return the last-known lists), an explicit async `refresh(provider?)` for dynamic providers, auth resolution (`getAuth`), and `stream`/`complete`/`streamSimple`/`completeSimple` that resolve auth through the owning provider. `createProvider()` builds providers from parts (single API implementation or a map dispatched on `model.api`; static `models` array plus an optional `refreshModels` fetcher with in-flight dedupe); `hasApi()` narrows dynamically listed models.
- Provider auth substrate: `ProviderAuth` (`{ apiKey?, oauth? }`), one type-tagged credential per provider, `CredentialStore` (`read`/`modify`/`delete` with serialized writes; in-memory default), `envApiKeyAuth()`, `lazyOAuth()`, and injectable `AuthContext`. OAuth refresh runs under the store lock with double-checked expiry; a stored credential owns its provider (no silent env fallback).
- One provider factory per built-in provider under `@earendil-works/pi-ai/providers/*` (e.g. `anthropicProvider()`, `openrouterProvider()`), plus `@earendil-works/pi-ai/providers/all` with `builtinProviders()`/`builtinModels()` and typed `getBuiltin*` catalog reads. Generated catalogs are split per provider, so importing one provider pulls one catalog; `sideEffects` metadata makes the package tree-shakeable.
- OAuth flows (Anthropic, OpenAI Codex, GitHub Copilot) gained `OAuthAuth` adapters (`login`/`refresh`/`toAuth`) on unified `prompt()`/`notify()` login callbacks; Copilot's per-credential base URL is derived in `toAuth()`.
- `fauxProvider()` returns a faux `Provider` for tests built on explicit `Models` collections.
- Image generation mirrors the chat-side design: `createImagesModels()`/`ImagesProvider`/`createImagesProvider()` with sync model reads, explicit `refresh()`, provider-resolved auth, and never-rejecting `generateImages()`; `openrouterImagesProvider()` factory plus `builtinImagesProviders()`/`builtinImagesModels()` in `providers/all`. The `ImagesProvider` id type alias is renamed to `ImagesProviderId`; the old global image API stays on `/compat`.
- Provider auth results can carry provider-scoped environment values that `Models` and `ImagesModels` merge into API implementation options.

### Fixed

- Fixed OpenAI Responses streams to fail when they end before a terminal response event and to treat `response.incomplete` as a length stop ([#5526](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/5526) by [@dmmulroy](https://github.com/dmmulroy)).
- Fixed Amazon Bedrock endpoint resolution to honor scoped `AWS_PROFILE` values.
- Fixed Cloudflare providers to require account/gateway configuration and route built-in `/compat` requests through provider auth.
- Fixed `/compat` API-key injection to honor request-scoped `env` values.
- Fixed OpenAI Codex Responses WebSocket sessions to reconnect once when OpenAI's connection limit is reached before output starts ([#5973](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/5973)).
- Fixed OpenCode Go GLM-5.2 metadata to expose `xhigh` reasoning and send `reasoning_effort: "max"` ([#5967](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/5967)).

## [0.79.10] - 2026-06-22

## [0.79.2] - 2026-06-12

### Added

- Added AWS data retention documentation links to Amazon Bedrock unsupported data retention mode validation errors ([#5561](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/5561) by [@unexge](https://github.com/unexge)).

- Fixed OpenRouter/Poolside context overflow detection for `maximum allowed input length` errors ([#4943](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/4943)).
- Fixed OpenAI Codex Responses WebSocket streams and SSE response-header waits to apply bounded timeouts instead of waiting indefinitely when no events arrive ([#4945](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/4945)).
- Fixed provider retry controls so OpenAI Codex Responses honors `maxRetries`, SDK retries default to `0`, and quota/billing 429s are not retried behind Pi's retry handling ([#4991](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/pull/4991) by [@mitsuhiko](https://github.com/mitsuhiko)).

## [0.75.5] - 2026-05-23

### Breaking Changes

- Changed `OAuthLoginCallbacks` to require `onDeviceCode` and `onSelect`, so OAuth providers can rely on pi supplying device-code and selection UI callbacks ([#4788](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/pull/4788) by [@vegarsti](https://github.com/vegarsti)).

### Fixed

- Fixed OpenAI prompt cache keys to clamp session-derived values to the 64-character API limit across OpenAI Responses, Chat Completions, Codex Responses, and Azure OpenAI Responses ([#4720](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/4720)).

## [0.75.3] - 2026-05-18

- Fixed Anthropic-compatible API-key requests to ignore unrelated `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` environment values, avoiding invalid bearer credentials for providers such as Xiaomi MiMo ([#4342](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/4342)).
- Fixed Amazon Bedrock message conversion to skip unknown content blocks instead of failing the stream ([#4223](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/4223)).
- Fixed Azure OpenAI Responses and OpenAI Responses error formatting to prefix HTTP status codes onto `errorMessage`, so transient 5xx and 429 errors are correctly matched by the agent-level auto-retry classifier ([#4232](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/4232)).
- Fixed Xiaomi MiMo model metadata to use the OpenAI-compatible endpoints and `openai-completions` API, restoring multi-turn thinking/tool-call sessions ([#4505](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/4505)).
- Fixed OpenCode Go Kimi reasoning replay by normalizing streamed `reasoning` fields back to `reasoning_content` for OpenCode Go only ([#4251](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/4251)).

### Removed

- Removed non-working OpenAI Codex fast model variants.

- Fixed OpenAI Codex generated model metadata to use the current upstream model list ([#4603](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/pull/4603) by [@mattiacerutti](https://github.com/mattiacerutti)).
- Fixed GitHub Copilot GPT model thinking metadata to map unsupported minimal thinking to low ([#4622](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/pull/4622) by [@mattiacerutti](https://github.com/mattiacerutti)).
- Fixed `streamSimple()` defaults for models whose advertised output limit is effectively their full context window to avoid impossible default requests ([#4614](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/4614)).

## [0.74.1] - 2026-05-16

### Added

- Added image generation APIs, image model metadata, and built-in OpenRouter image generation support ([#3887](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/pull/3887) by [@cristinaponcela](https://github.com/cristinaponcela)).
- Added Together AI as a built-in OpenAI-compatible provider with generated model metadata and `TOGETHER_API_KEY` authentication ([#3624](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/pull/3624) by [@Nutlope](https://github.com/Nutlope)).

### Fixed

- Fixed GitHub Copilot model availability to ignore generic `GH_TOKEN` and `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variables, requiring OAuth login or `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN` instead ([#4485](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/4485)).
- Fixed `openai-completions` streams to surface an error when the stream ends before any terminal `finish_reason`, so truncated responses can retry instead of being accepted as success ([#4345](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/4345)).
- Fixed Fireworks provider caching compatibility by adding session affinity headers and model metadata compat settings ([#4358](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/pull/4358) by [@yanirz](https://github.com/yanirz)).
- Fixed OpenAI Codex WebSocket transport to respect proxy environment variables under Bun ([#4354](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/pull/4354) by [@haoqixu](https://github.com/haoqixu)).
- Fixed OpenRouter cache usage normalization to preserve cached-token semantics without treating cached tokens as cache writes.
- Fixed Bedrock proxy handling to preserve `NO_PROXY` exclusions while using HTTP(S)-only proxy agents.
- Fixed compiled Bun binaries failing to start outside the repo when Bedrock proxy support tried to resolve `proxy-from-env` from external `node_modules` ([#4513](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/4513)).
- Fixed GitHub Copilot Claude test coverage to use the current Claude Sonnet 4.6 model ID.
- Fixed OpenAI Responses requests for models that support disabling reasoning to send `reasoning.effort: "none"` when thinking is off.
- Fixed Inception Mercury 2 tool calling on OpenRouter by marking `off` as unsupported in `thinkingLevelMap`, so the openai-completions provider omits the reasoning param instead of defaulting to `{reasoning:{effort:"none"}}` (which puts Mercury 2 in instant mode, disabling tool calls).
- Fixed OpenAI Codex SSE retries to honor `retry-after-ms` and `retry-after` headers before falling back to exponential backoff.
- Fixed context overflow detection for LiteLLM-wrapped OpenAI-compatible errors using `exceeds the model's maximum context length of ... tokens` wording ([#4563](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/4563)).
- Fixed `streamSimple()` defaults to respect model output limits above 32000 tokens instead of clamping provider requests to 32000 ([#4539](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/4539)).

## [0.74.0] - 2026-05-07

## [0.73.1] - 2026-05-07

### Added

- Added OAuth login flow metadata so clients can present interactive provider choices during login ([#4190](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/pull/4190) by [@mitsuhiko](https://github.com/mitsuhiko)).

### Fixed

- Fixed OpenAI Responses reasoning text streaming for LM Studio and other compatible providers that emit `response.reasoning_text.delta` events ([#4191](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/4191) by [@yaanfpv](https://github.com/yaanfpv)).
- Fixed OpenAI Codex OAuth refresh failures writing directly to stderr while the TUI is active ([#4141](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/4141)).
- Fixed OpenAI-compatible chat completion streams that interleave content and tool-call deltas in the same choice.
- Fixed the Kimi K2 P6 model alias to normalize to `kimi-for-coding` ([#4218](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/issues/4218)).
- Fixed OpenAI Codex Responses requests to send a non-empty system prompt ([#4184](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/issues/4184)).

## [0.73.0] - 2026-05-04

### Breaking Changes

- Switched the built-in `xiaomi` provider endpoint from Token Plan AMS (`https://token-plan-ams.xiaomimimo.com/anthropic`) to API billing (`https://api.xiaomimimo.com/anthropic`). `XIAOMI_API_KEY` now refers to the API billing key from [platform.xiaomimimo.com](https://platform.xiaomimimo.com). Users still on Token Plan must move to the appropriate `xiaomi-token-plan-*` provider and set the corresponding env var ([#4112](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/4112) by [@Phoen1xCode](https://github.com/Phoen1xCode)).

### Added

- Added Xiaomi MiMo Token Plan regional providers with per-region env vars: `xiaomi-token-plan-cn` (`XIAOMI_TOKEN_PLAN_CN_API_KEY`), `xiaomi-token-plan-ams` (`XIAOMI_TOKEN_PLAN_AMS_API_KEY`), and `xiaomi-token-plan-sgp` (`XIAOMI_TOKEN_PLAN_SGP_API_KEY`) ([#4112](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/4112) by [@Phoen1xCode](https://github.com/Phoen1xCode)).
- Added `registerSessionResourceCleanup()` and `cleanupSessionResources()` so providers can register cleanup hooks for session-scoped resources.

### Fixed

- Fixed generated OpenAI-compatible model metadata for Qwen 3.5/3.6 and MiniMax M2.7 to match models.dev and OpenCode Go ([#4110](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/4110) by [@jsynowiec](https://github.com/jsynowiec)).
- Fixed Bedrock Converse thinking effort mapping to preserve native `xhigh` for Claude Opus 4.7.
- Fixed OpenAI Codex Responses WebSocket transport to fall back to SSE when setup fails before streaming starts, and attach transport diagnostics to the assistant message ([#4133](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/4133)).

## [0.72.1] - 2026-05-02

## [0.72.0] - 2026-05-01

### Breaking Changes

- Replaced `OpenAICompletionsCompat.reasoningEffortMap` with top-level `Model.thinkingLevelMap` for model-specific thinking controls ([#3208](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3208)). Migration: move mappings from `model.compat.reasoningEffortMap` to `model.thinkingLevelMap`. See `packages/ai/README.md#custom-models` and `packages/coding-agent/docs/models.md#thinking-level-map`. Map values keep the same provider-specific string semantics, and `null` marks a pi thinking level unsupported. Example:
  ```ts
  // Before
  compat: { reasoningEffortMap: { high: "high", xhigh: "max" } }

  // After
  thinkingLevelMap: { minimal: null, low: null, medium: null, high: "high", xhigh: "max" }
  ```
- Removed `supportsXhigh()`. Migration: use `getSupportedThinkingLevels(model).includes("xhigh")` or `clampThinkingLevel(model, requestedLevel)` instead ([#3208](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3208)).

### Added

- Added Xiaomi MiMo Token Plan provider (Anthropic-compatible) with `XIAOMI_API_KEY` authentication ([#4005](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/4005) by [@Phoen1xCode](https://github.com/Phoen1xCode)).
- Added `Model.thinkingLevelMap`, `getSupportedThinkingLevels()`, and `clampThinkingLevel()` so model metadata can describe supported thinking levels and provider-specific level values ([#3208](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3208)).

### Fixed

- Fixed OpenAI Codex Responses `streamSimple()` to honor the configured transport instead of always using SSE, and made `auto` the default transport with cached WebSocket context when available ([#4083](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/4083)).
- Fixed Xiaomi MiMo model catalog to use the Token Plan Anthropic endpoint instead of the direct API ([#3912](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3912)).

## [0.71.1] - 2026-05-01

### Added

- Added `websocket-cached` transport support for OpenAI Codex Responses used with ChatGPT subscription auth. This keeps the same WebSocket open for a session and, after the first request, sends only new conversation items instead of resending the full chat history when possible.

## [0.71.0] - 2026-04-30

### Breaking Changes

- Removed built-in Google Gemini CLI and Google Antigravity support, including provider registration, model metadata, OAuth, and package exports. Existing callers must switch to another supported provider.

### Added

- Added Cloudflare AI Gateway as a built-in provider with OpenAI, Anthropic, and Workers AI gateway routing plus `CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY`/`CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`/`CLOUDFLARE_GATEWAY_ID` authentication ([#3856](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3856) by [@mchenco](https://github.com/mchenco)).
- Added Moonshot AI as a built-in OpenAI-compatible provider with model catalog generation and `MOONSHOT_API_KEY` authentication.
- Added Mistral Medium 3.5 model metadata and reasoning-mode handling ([#4009](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/4009) by [@technocidal](https://github.com/technocidal)).
- Added `AssistantMessage.responseModel` on the openai-completions path: surfaces the concrete `chunk.model` when it differs from the requested id (e.g. OpenRouter `auto` -> `anthropic/...`) ([#3968](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3968) by [@purrgrammer](https://github.com/purrgrammer)).

### Fixed

- Fixed Google Vertex Gemini 3 tool call replay by no longer sending the non-Vertex `skip_thought_signature_validator` sentinel for unsigned tool calls ([#4032](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/4032)).
- Updated `@anthropic-ai/sdk` to `^0.91.1` to clear GHSA-p7fg-763f-g4gf audit findings ([#3992](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3992)).
- Fixed DeepSeek V4 Flash `xhigh` thinking support so requests preserve `xhigh` and map it to DeepSeek's `max` reasoning effort ([#3944](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3944)).
- Fixed Anthropic streams that end before `message_stop` to be treated as errors instead of successful partial responses ([#3936](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3936)).
- Fixed generated OpenAI-compatible DeepSeek V4 models to carry the provider-specific reasoning effort mapping outside the direct DeepSeek provider ([#3940](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3940)).
- Fixed DeepSeek V4 Flash and V4 Pro pricing metadata to match current official rates ([#3910](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3910)).
- Fixed DeepSeek prompt cache hits to be tracked from `prompt_cache_hit_tokens` in OpenAI-compatible usage responses ([#3880](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3880)).

### Removed

- Removed built-in Google Gemini CLI and Google Antigravity provider, model, OAuth, and export support.

## [0.70.6] - 2026-04-28

### Added

- Added Cloudflare Workers AI as a built-in provider with model catalog generation, `CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY`/`CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` authentication, and OpenAI-compatible streaming support ([#3851](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3851) by [@mchenco](https://github.com/mchenco)).

### Fixed

- Removed generated Cloudflare Workers AI `User-Agent` model headers so attribution can be controlled by callers.
- Fixed Bedrock inference profile capability checks by normalizing profile ARNs to the underlying model name.

## [0.70.5] - 2026-04-27

## [0.70.4] - 2026-04-27

## [0.70.3] - 2026-04-27

### Added

- Added Azure Cognitive Services endpoint support for Azure OpenAI Responses base URLs ([#3799](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3799) by [@marcbloech](https://github.com/marcbloech)).

### Changed

- Changed OpenAI Codex Responses default text verbosity to `low` when no verbosity is specified.

### Fixed

- Fixed API-key environment discovery to fall back to `/proc/self/environ` when Bun's sandbox leaves `process.env` empty ([#3801](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3801) by [@mdsjip](https://github.com/mdsjip)).
- Fixed Bedrock prompt-caching and adaptive-thinking capability checks to use the model name when the model id is an inference profile ARN ([#3527](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3527) by [@anirudhmarc](https://github.com/anirudhmarc)).
- Fixed Anthropic SSE parsing to ignore unknown proxy events such as OpenAI-style `done` terminators ([#3708](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3708)).
- Fixed OpenAI-compatible prompt cache tests to cover proxies that explicitly disable long cache retention.
- Stopped sending `tools: []` on OpenAI-compatible, Anthropic, OpenAI Responses, OpenAI Codex Responses, and Azure OpenAI Responses requests when no tools are active (e.g. `pi --no-tools`). DashScope/Aliyun Qwen (OpenAI-compatible) rejects empty tools arrays with `"[] is too short - 'tools'"` (HTTP 400); the field is now omitted unless the conversation has tool history (the existing LiteLLM/Anthropic-proxy workaround) ([#3650](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3650) by [@HQidea](https://github.com/HQidea)).
- Fixed `supportsXhigh()` to recognize DeepSeek V4 Pro, preserving `xhigh` reasoning requests so they map to DeepSeek's `max` effort ([#3662](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3662))
- Fixed OpenAI-compatible DeepSeek V4 model replay to include empty `reasoning_content` on assistant messages when needed, preventing OpenRouter DeepSeek V4 sessions from failing after responses without reasoning deltas ([#3668](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3668))

## [0.70.2] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed

- Fixed OpenAI/Azure/Anthropic provider request option forwarding to omit undefined `timeout`/`maxRetries`, avoiding SDK validation errors such as `timeout must be an integer` when provider controls are not set ([#3627](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3627))

## [0.70.1] - 2026-04-24

### Added

- Added DeepSeek as a built-in OpenAI-compatible provider with V4 Flash and V4 Pro models and `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` authentication.

### Fixed

- Fixed DeepSeek V4 session replay 400 errors by adding `thinkingFormat: "deepseek"` (sends `thinking: { type }` + `reasoning_effort`), a `reasoningEffortMap`, and `requiresReasoningContentOnAssistantMessages` compat that injects empty `reasoning_content` on all replayed assistant messages when reasoning is enabled ([#3636](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3636))
- Fixed GPT-5.5 generated context window metadata to use the observed 272k limit.
- Fixed provider request controls to expose `timeoutMs` and `maxRetries` in stream options and forward them through OpenAI/Azure/Anthropic request options, preventing unconfigurable SDK timeout/retry defaults on long-running local inference requests ([#3627](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3627))

## [0.70.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added

- Added GPT-5.5 to OpenAI Codex model generation.
- Added `findEnvKeys()` so callers can identify configured provider API-key environment variables without exposing credential values while preserving `getEnvApiKey()` as the credential-value API.

### Fixed

- Fixed `google-vertex` to forward custom `model.baseUrl` values to `@google/genai`, enabling Vertex proxy and gateway endpoints ([#3619](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3619))
- Fixed OpenAI-compatible completion usage parsing to stop double-counting reasoning tokens already included in `completion_tokens` ([#3581](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3581))
- Fixed long cache retention compatibility by adding `compat.supportsLongCacheRetention`, allowing Anthropic Messages and OpenAI-compatible proxies to explicitly disable long-retention fields while enabling long retention by default when requested ([#3543](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3543))
- Fixed `openai-responses` compatibility by adding `compat.sendSessionIdHeader: false`, allowing strict OpenAI-compatible proxies to omit the underscore-containing `session_id` header while still sending other session-affinity headers ([#3579](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3579))
- Fixed `anthropic-messages` tool streaming compatibility by adding `compat.supportsEagerToolInputStreaming`, allowing Anthropic-compatible providers to omit per-tool `eager_input_streaming` and use the legacy fine-grained tool streaming beta header instead ([#3575](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3575))
- Fixed `supportsXhigh()` to recognize `openai-codex` `gpt-5.5`, preserving `xhigh` reasoning requests instead of clamping them to `high`.
- Fixed `openai-completions` streamed tool-call assembly to coalesce deltas by stable tool index when OpenAI-compatible gateways mutate tool call IDs mid-stream, preventing malformed Kimi K2.6/OpenCode tool streams from splitting one call into multiple bogus tool calls ([#3576](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3576))
- Fixed `packages/ai` E2E coverage to use currently supported OpenAI Responses and OpenAI Codex models, and updated the Bedrock adaptive-thinking payload expectation to match the current `display: "summarized"` shape.
- Fixed built-in `kimi-coding` model generation to attach `User-Agent: KimiCLI/1.5` to all generated Kimi models, overriding the Anthropic SDK default UA so direct Kimi Coding requests use the provider's expected client identity ([#3586](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3586))
- Fixed GPT-5.5 Codex capability handling to clamp unsupported minimal reasoning to `low` and apply the model's 2.5x priority service-tier pricing multiplier ([#3618](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3618) by [@markusylisiurunen](https://github.com/markusylisiurunen))

## [0.69.0] - 2026-04-22

### Breaking Changes

- Migrated TypeBox support from `@sinclair/typebox` 0.34.x plus AJV to `typebox` 1.x plus TypeBox's built-in validator and value-conversion APIs. Tool argument validation now runs in eval-restricted JavaScript runtimes such as Cloudflare Workers and other environments that disallow `eval` / `new Function`, instead of being silently skipped. Migration: install and import from `typebox` instead of `@sinclair/typebox`, and retest any coercion-sensitive tool paths that serialize schemas to plain JSON because those now go through the new TypeBox-based validation and coercion path rather than AJV ([#3112](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3112))

### Fixed

- Fixed `google-gemini-cli` built-in model discovery to include `gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview`, so Cloud Code Assist model lists expose it without requiring manual `--model` fallback selection ([#3545](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3545))
- Fixed `transformMessages()` to synthesize missing trailing tool results for transcripts that end with unresolved assistant tool calls during direct low-level history replay ([#3555](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3555))

## [0.68.1] - 2026-04-22

### Added

- Added Fireworks provider support via Fireworks' Anthropic-compatible Messages API, including built-in models sourced from models.dev and `FIREWORKS_API_KEY` auth ([#3519](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3519))

### Fixed

- Hardened Anthropic streaming against malformed tool-call JSON by owning SSE parsing with defensive JSON repair, replacing the deprecated `fine-grained-tool-streaming` beta header with per-tool `eager_input_streaming`, and updating stale test model references ([#3175](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3175))
- Fixed Bedrock runtime endpoint resolution to stop pinning built-in regional endpoints over `AWS_REGION` / `AWS_PROFILE`, restoring `us.*` and `eu.*` inference profile support after v0.68.0 while preserving custom VPC/proxy endpoint overrides ([#3481](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3481), [#3485](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3485), [#3486](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3486), [#3487](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3487), [#3488](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3488))

## [0.68.0] - 2026-04-20

### Added

- Added `PI_OAUTH_CALLBACK_HOST` support for built-in Anthropic, Gemini CLI, Google Antigravity, and OpenAI Codex OAuth flows, allowing local callback servers to bind to a custom interface instead of hardcoded `127.0.0.1` ([#3409](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3409) by [@Michaelliv](https://github.com/Michaelliv))

### Changed

- Changed Bedrock Converse requests to omit `inferenceConfig.maxTokens` when model token limits are unknown and to omit `temperature` when unset, letting Bedrock use model defaults and avoid unnecessary TPM quota reservation ([#3400](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3400) by [@wirjo](https://github.com/wirjo))

### Fixed

- Fixed `openai-completions` `compat.requiresThinkingAsText` assistant replay to preserve text-part serialization and avoid same-model crashes when prior assistant messages contain both thinking and text ([#3387](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3387))
- Fixed Cloud Code Assist tool schemas to strip JSON Schema meta-declaration keys such as `$schema`, `$defs`, and `definitions` before sending OpenAPI `parameters`, avoiding provider validation failures for tool-enabled requests ([#3412](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3412) by [@vladlearns](https://github.com/vladlearns))
- Fixed non-vision model requests to replace user and tool-result image blocks with explicit text placeholders instead of silently dropping them during provider payload conversion ([#3429](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3429))
- Fixed direct OpenAI Chat Completions requests to map `sessionId` and `cacheRetention` to OpenAI prompt caching fields, sending `prompt_cache_key` when caching is enabled and `prompt_cache_retention: "24h"` for direct `api.openai.com` requests with long retention ([#3426](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3426))
- Fixed OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions requests to optionally send aligned `session_id`, `x-client-request-id`, and `x-session-affinity` session-affinity headers from `sessionId` via `compat.sendSessionAffinityHeaders`, enabling cache-affinity routing for backends such as Fireworks ([#3430](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3430))
- Fixed direct Bedrock runtime client construction to pass `model.baseUrl` through as the SDK `endpoint`, restoring support for custom Bedrock endpoints such as VPC or proxy routes ([#3402](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3402) by [@wirjo](https://github.com/wirjo))
- Fixed OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions Anthropic-style prompt caching to apply `cache_control` markers to the system prompt, last tool definition, and last user/assistant text content via `compat.cacheControlFormat`, and enabled that compat for OpenCode/OpenCode Go Qwen 3.5/3.6 Plus models so prompt caching works there too ([#3392](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3392))

## [0.67.68] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed

- Fixed Bedrock bearer-token authentication to use the SDK's native token auth path and omit Claude `thinking.display` for GovCloud targets, avoiding duplicate `Authorization` headers and GovCloud Converse validation errors ([#3359](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3359))
- Fixed direct Mistral tool definitions to strip TypeBox symbol metadata before passing schemas to the SDK, restoring tool calls after the SDK's stricter outbound validation ([#3361](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3361))

## [0.67.67] - 2026-04-17

### Added

- Added Bedrock Converse bearer-token authentication via `AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK`, enabling API-key style access without SigV4 credentials ([#3125](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3125) by [@wirjo](https://github.com/wirjo))

### Fixed

- Fixed Anthropic and Bedrock adaptive-thinking payload tests to expect the default `display: "summarized"` field when reasoning is enabled.
- Fixed Mistral Small 4 reasoning requests to use `reasoning_effort` instead of `prompt_mode`, restoring default thinking support for `mistral-small-2603` and `mistral-small-latest` ([#3338](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3338))
- Fixed `qwen-chat-template` OpenAI-compatible requests to set `chat_template_kwargs.preserve_thinking: true`, preserving prior Qwen thinking across turns so multi-turn tool calls keep their arguments instead of degrading to empty `{}` payloads ([#3325](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3325))
- Fixed OpenAI Codex service-tier accounting to trust the explicitly requested tier when the API echoes the default tier in responses, keeping downstream usage costs aligned with the caller-selected tier ([#3307](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3307) by [@markusylisiurunen](https://github.com/markusylisiurunen))

## [0.67.6] - 2026-04-16

### Added

- Added `onResponse` to `StreamOptions` so callers can inspect provider HTTP status and headers after each response arrives and before the response stream is consumed ([#3128](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3128))
- Added `thinkingDisplay` (`"summarized" | "omitted"`) to `AnthropicOptions` and `BedrockOptions`, wiring it through to the Anthropic/Bedrock `thinking` config. Defaults to `"summarized"` so Claude Opus 4.7 and Mythos Preview keep returning thinking text; set it to `"omitted"` to skip thinking streaming for faster time-to-first-text-token.

### Fixed

- Fixed OpenAI Responses prompt caching for non-`api.openai.com` base URLs (OpenAI-compatible proxies such as litellm, theclawbay) by sending the `session_id` and `x-client-request-id` cache-affinity headers unconditionally when a `sessionId` is provided, matching the official Codex CLI behavior ([#3264](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3264) by [@vegarsti](https://github.com/vegarsti))

## [0.67.5] - 2026-04-16

### Fixed

- Fixed Opus 4.7 adaptive thinking configuration across Anthropic and Bedrock providers by recognizing Opus 4.7 adaptive-thinking support and mapping `xhigh` reasoning to provider-supported effort values ([#3286](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3286) by [@markusylisiurunen](https://github.com/markusylisiurunen))

## [0.67.4] - 2026-04-16

### Changed

- Added `claude-opus-4-7` model for Anthropic, OpenRouter.
- Changed Anthropic prompt caching to add a `cache_control` breakpoint on the last tool definition, so tool schemas can be cached independently from transcript updates while preserving existing cache retention behavior ([#3260](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3260))
- Changed Kimi Coding model generation to normalize deprecated `k2p5` to `kimi-for-coding` from models.dev data and removed the old static fallback model list ([#3242](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3242))

## [0.67.3] - 2026-04-15

### Fixed

- Fixed `google-vertex` API key resolution to treat `gcp-vertex-credentials` as an Application Default Credentials marker instead of a literal API key, so marker-based setups correctly fall back to ADC ([#3221](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3221) by [@deepkilo](https://github.com/deepkilo))

## [0.67.2] - 2026-04-14

### Fixed

- Fixed direct OpenAI Responses requests to send aligned `prompt_cache_key`, `session_id`, and `x-client-request-id` values when `sessionId` is provided, improving prompt cache affinity for append-only sessions ([#3018](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3018) by [@steipete](https://github.com/steipete))
- Fixed streaming-only `partialJson` scratch buffers leaking into persisted OpenAI Responses tool calls, which could corrupt follow-up payloads on resumed conversations.

## [0.67.1] - 2026-04-13

## [0.67.0] - 2026-04-13

### Added

- Added full `OpenRouterRouting` field support, including fallbacks, parameter requirements, data collection, ZDR, ignore lists, quantizations, provider sorting, max price, and preferred throughput and latency constraints ([#2904](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2904) by [@zmberber](https://github.com/zmberber))

### Fixed

- Bumped default Antigravity User-Agent version to `1.21.9` ([#2901](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2901) by [@aadishv](https://github.com/aadishv))
- Fixed thinking levels for Gemma 4 models to use `thinkingLevel` and map Pi reasoning levels to the model's supported thinking levels ([#2903](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2903) by [@aadishv](https://github.com/aadishv))
- Fixed Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite minimal thinking budget to use the model's supported 512-token minimum instead of the regular Flash 128-token minimum, avoiding invalid thinking budget errors ([#2861](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2861) by [@JasonOA888](https://github.com/JasonOA888))
- Fixed OpenAI Codex Responses requests to forward configured `serviceTier` values, restoring service-tier selection for Codex sessions ([#2996](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2996) by [@markusylisiurunen](https://github.com/markusylisiurunen))

## [0.66.1] - 2026-04-08

## [0.66.0] - 2026-04-08

### Fixed

- Fixed bare `readline` import to use `node:readline` prefix for Deno compatibility ([#2885](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2885) by [@milosv-vtool](https://github.com/milosv-vtool))

## [0.65.2] - 2026-04-06

## [0.65.1] - 2026-04-05

### Fixed

- Fixed OpenAI-compatible completions streaming usage to preserve `prompt_tokens_details.cache_write_tokens` and normalize OpenRouter `cached_tokens` to previous-request cache hits only, preventing cache read/write double counting in `usage` and cost calculation ([#2802](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2802))

## [0.65.0] - 2026-04-03

### Added

- Added tool streaming support for newer Z.ai models ([#2732](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2732) by [@kaofelix](https://github.com/kaofelix))

### Fixed

- Fixed Anthropic context overflow detection to recognize HTTP 413 `request_too_large` errors, so callers can trigger compaction and retry instead of getting stuck on repeated oversized-image requests ([#2734](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2734))
- Fixed OpenAI Responses tool-call streaming to emit a `toolcall_delta` when function call arguments arrive only in `response.function_call_arguments.done`, and to emit only the missing suffix when `.done` extends earlier streamed arguments ([#2745](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2745))
- Fixed Bedrock throttling errors being misidentified as context overflow, causing unnecessary compaction instead of retry ([#2699](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2699) by [@xu0o0](https://github.com/xu0o0))

## [0.64.0] - 2026-03-29

### Added

- Added opt-in faux provider helpers for deterministic tests and scripted demos: `registerFauxProvider()`, `fauxAssistantMessage()`, `fauxText()`, `fauxThinking()`, and `fauxToolCall()`.

## [0.63.2] - 2026-03-29

## [0.63.1] - 2026-03-27

### Added

- Added `gemini-3.1-pro-preview-customtools` model support for the `google-vertex` provider ([#2610](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2610) by [@gordonhwc](https://github.com/gordonhwc))

### Fixed

- Fixed context overflow detection to recognize Ollama error responses like `prompt too long; exceeded max context length ...`, so callers can trigger compaction and retry instead of surfacing the raw overflow error ([#2626](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2626))

## [0.63.0] - 2026-03-27

### Breaking Changes

- Removed deprecated direct `minimax` and `minimax-cn` model IDs, keeping only `MiniMax-M2.7` and `MiniMax-M2.7-highspeed`. Update pinned model IDs to one of those supported direct MiniMax models, or use another provider route that still exposes the older IDs ([#2596](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2596) by [@liyuan97](https://github.com/liyuan97))

### Fixed

- Fixed GitHub Copilot OpenAI Responses requests to omit the `reasoning` field entirely when no reasoning effort is requested, avoiding `400` errors from Copilot `gpt-5-mini` rejecting `reasoning: { effort: "none" }` during internal summary calls ([#2567](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2567))
- Fixed Google and Vertex cost calculation to subtract cached prompt tokens from billable input tokens instead of double-counting them when providers report `cachedContentTokenCount` ([#2588](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2588) by [@sparkleMing](https://github.com/sparkleMing))

## [0.62.0] - 2026-03-23

### Added

- Added `requestMetadata` option to `BedrockOptions` for AWS cost allocation tagging; key-value pairs are forwarded to the Bedrock Converse API `requestMetadata` field and appear in AWS Cost Explorer split cost allocation data ([#2511](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2511) by [@wjonaskr](https://github.com/wjonaskr))
- Exported `BedrockOptions` type from the package root entry point, consistent with other provider option types.

### Fixed

- Fixed OpenAI Responses replay for foreign tool-call item IDs by hashing foreign `function_call.id` values into bounded `fc_<hash>` IDs instead of preserving backend-specific normalized shapes that OpenAI Codex rejects.
- Fixed Anthropic thinking disable handling to send `thinking: { type: "disabled" }` for reasoning-capable models when thinking is explicitly off, and added payload and env-gated end-to-end coverage for the Anthropic provider ([#2022](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2022))
- Fixed explicit thinking disable handling across Google, Google Vertex, Gemini CLI, OpenAI Responses, Azure OpenAI Responses, and OpenRouter-backed OpenAI-compatible completions. Gemini 3 models now fall back to the lowest supported thinking level when full disable is not supported, and OpenAI/OpenRouter reasoning models now send explicit `none` effort instead of relying on provider defaults ([#2490](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2490))
- Fixed OpenAI-compatible completions streams to ignore null chunks instead of crashing ([#2466](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2466) by [@Cheng-Zi-Qing](https://github.com/Cheng-Zi-Qing))

## [0.61.1] - 2026-03-20

### Changed

- Changed MiniMax model metadata to add missing `MiniMax-M2.1-highspeed` entries for the `minimax` and `minimax-cn` providers and normalize MiniMax Anthropic-compatible context limits to the provider's supported model set ([#2445](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2445) by [@1500256797](https://github.com/1500256797))

## [0.61.0] - 2026-03-20

### Added

- Added `gpt-5.4-mini` model support for the `openai-codex` provider with Codex pricing metadata and unit coverage ([#2334](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2334) by [@justram](https://github.com/justram))

### Fixed

- Fixed `validateToolArguments()` to fall back gracefully when AJV schema compilation is blocked in restricted runtimes such as Cloudflare Workers, allowing tool execution to proceed without schema validation ([#2395](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2395))
- Fixed `google-vertex` API key resolution to ignore placeholder auth markers like `<authenticated>` and fall back to ADC instead of sending them as literal API keys ([#2335](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2335))
- Fixed OpenRouter reasoning requests to use the provider's nested `reasoning.effort` payload instead of OpenAI's `reasoning_effort`, restoring thinking level support for OpenRouter models ([#2298](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2298) by [@PriNova](https://github.com/PriNova))
- Fixed Bedrock prompt caching for application inference profiles by allowing cache points to be forced with `AWS_BEDROCK_FORCE_CACHE=1` when the profile ARN does not expose the underlying Claude model name ([#2346](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2346) by [@haoqixu](https://github.com/haoqixu))

## [0.60.0] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed

- Fixed Gemini 3 and Antigravity image tool results to stay inline as multimodal tool responses instead of being rerouted through separate follow-up messages ([#2052](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2052))
- Fixed Bedrock Claude 4.6 model metadata to use the correct 200K context window instead of 1M ([#2305](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2305))
- Fixed lazy built-in provider registration so compiled Bun binaries can still load providers on first use without eagerly bundling provider SDKs ([#2314](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2314))
- Fixed built-in OAuth callback flows to share aligned callback handling across Anthropic, Gemini CLI, Antigravity, and OpenAI Codex, and fixed OpenAI Codex login to resolve immediately after callback completion ([#2316](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2316))
- Fixed OpenAI-compatible z.ai `network_error` responses to surface as errors so callers can retry them instead of treating them as successful assistant messages ([#2313](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2313))
- Fixed OpenAI Responses replay to normalize oversized resumed tool call IDs before sending them back to Codex and other Responses-compatible targets ([#2328](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2328))

## [0.59.0] - 2026-03-17

### Added

- Added `client` injection support to `AnthropicOptions`, allowing callers to provide a pre-built Anthropic-compatible client instead of constructing one internally.

### Changed

- Lazy-load built-in provider modules and root provider wrappers so importing `@mariozechner/pi-ai` no longer eagerly loads provider SDKs, significantly reducing base startup cost without changing dependency installation footprint ([#2297](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2297))

### Fixed

- Added provider-specific `responseId` support on `AssistantMessage` for providers that expose upstream response or message identifiers, including Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Gemini CLI, and Mistral, and added end-to-end coverage for supported OAuth and API key providers ([#2245](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2245))
- Fixed Claude 4.6 context window overrides in generated model metadata so build-time catalogs reflect the intended values ([#2286](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2286))

## [0.58.4] - 2026-03-16

## [0.58.3] - 2026-03-15

## [0.58.2] - 2026-03-15

### Fixed

- Fixed Anthropic OAuth manual login and token refresh by using the localhost callback URI for pasted redirect/code flows and omitting `scope` from refresh-token requests ([#2169](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2169))

## [0.58.1] - 2026-03-14

### Fixed

- Fixed OpenAI Codex websocket protocol to include required headers and properly terminate SSE streams on connection close ([#1961](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1961))
- Fixed Bedrock prompt caching being enabled for non-Claude models, causing API errors ([#2053](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2053))
- Fixed Qwen models via OpenAI-compatible providers by adding `qwen-chat-template` compat mode that uses Qwen's native chat template format ([#2020](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2020))
- Fixed Bedrock unsigned thinking replay to handle edge cases with empty or malformed thinking blocks ([#2063](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2063))
- Fixed xhigh reasoning effort detection for Claude Opus 4.6 to match by model ID instead of requiring explicit capability flag ([#2040](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2040))
- Handle `finish_reason: "end"` from Ollama/LM Studio by mapping it to `"stop"` instead of throwing ([#2142](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2142))

## [0.58.0] - 2026-03-14

### Added

- Added `GOOGLE_CLOUD_API_KEY` environment variable support for the `google-vertex` provider as an alternative to Application Default Credentials ([#1976](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1976) by [@gordonhwc](https://github.com/gordonhwc))

### Changed

- Raised Claude Opus 4.6, Sonnet 4.6, and related Bedrock model context windows from 200K to 1M tokens ([#2135](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2135) by [@mitsuhiko](https://github.com/mitsuhiko))

### Fixed

- Fixed GitHub Copilot device-code login polling to respect OAuth slow-down intervals, wait before the first token poll, and include a clearer clock-drift hint in WSL/VM environments when repeated slow-downs lead to timeout.
- Fixed usage statistics not being captured for OpenAI-compatible providers that return usage in `choice.usage` instead of the standard `chunk.usage` (e.g., Moonshot/Kimi) ([#2017](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2017))
- Fixed tool result images not being sent in `function_call_output` items for OpenAI Responses API providers, causing image data to be silently dropped in tool results ([#2104](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2104))
- Fixed assistant content being sent as structured content blocks instead of plain strings in the `openai-completions` provider, causing errors with some OpenAI-compatible backends ([#2008](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2008) by [@geraldoaax](https://github.com/geraldoaax))
- Fixed error details in OpenAI Responses `response.failed` handler to include status code, error code, and message instead of a generic failure ([#1956](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1956) by [@drewburr](https://github.com/drewburr))

## [0.57.1] - 2026-03-07

### Fixed

- Fixed context overflow detection to recognize z.ai `model_context_window_exceeded` errors surfaced through OpenAI-compatible stop reason handling ([#1937](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1937))

## [0.57.0] - 2026-03-07

### Added

- Added per-request payload inspection and replacement hook support via `beforeProviderRequest`, allowing callers to inspect or replace provider payloads before sending.

## [0.56.3] - 2026-03-06

### Added

- Added `claude-sonnet-4-6` model for the `google-antigravity` provider ([#1859](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1859)).
- Bumped default Antigravity User-Agent version to `1.18.4` ([#1859](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1859)).

### Fixed

- Fixed Antigravity Claude thinking beta header detection to use provider and model capability instead of `-thinking` suffix, so models like `claude-sonnet-4-6` receive the header correctly ([#1859](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1859)).
- Fixed OpenAI Responses reasoning replay regression that dropped reasoning blocks on follow-up turns ([#1878](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1878))

## [0.56.2] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- Added `gpt-5.4` model support for `openai`, `openai-codex`, `azure-openai-responses`, and `opencode` providers, with GPT-5.4 treated as xhigh-capable and capped to a 272000 context window in built-in metadata.
- Added `gpt-5.3-codex` fallback model availability for `github-copilot` until upstream model catalogs include it ([#1853](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1853)).

### Fixed

- Preserved OpenAI Responses assistant `phase` metadata (`commentary`, `final_answer`) across turns by encoding `id` and `phase` in `textSignature` for session persistence and replay, with backward compatibility for legacy plain signatures ([#1819](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1819)).
- Fixed OpenAI Responses replay to omit empty thinking blocks, avoiding invalid no-op reasoning items in follow-up turns.
- Switched the Mistral provider from the OpenAI-compatible completions path to Mistral's native SDK and conversations API, preserving native thinking blocks and Mistral-specific message semantics across turns ([#1716](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1716)).
- Fixed Antigravity endpoint fallback: 403/404 responses now cascade to the next endpoint instead of throwing immediately, added `autopush-cloudcode-pa.sandbox` endpoint to the fallback list, and removed extra fingerprint headers (`X-Goog-Api-Client`, `Client-Metadata`) from Antigravity requests ([#1830](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1830)).
- Fixed `@mariozechner/pi-ai/oauth` package exports to point directly at built `dist` files, avoiding broken TypeScript resolution through unpublished wrapper targets ([#1856](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1856)).
- Fixed Gemini 3 unsigned tool call replay: use `skip_thought_signature_validator` sentinel instead of converting function calls to text, preserving structured tool call context across multi-turn conversations ([#1829](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1829)).

## [0.56.1] - 2026-03-05

## [0.56.0] - 2026-03-04

### Breaking Changes

- Moved Node OAuth runtime exports off the top-level package entry. Import OAuth login/refresh functions from `@mariozechner/pi-ai/oauth` instead of `@mariozechner/pi-ai` ([#1814](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1814))

### Added

- Added `gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview` fallback model entry for the `google` provider so it remains selectable until upstream model catalogs include it ([#1785](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1785), thanks [@n-WN](https://github.com/n-WN)).
- Added OpenCode Go provider support with `opencode-go` model catalog entries and `OPENCODE_API_KEY` environment variable support ([#1757](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1757)).

### Changed

- Updated Antigravity Gemini 3.1 model metadata and request headers to match current upstream behavior.

### Fixed

- Fixed Gemini 3.1 thinking-level detection in `google` and `google-vertex` providers so `gemini-3.1-*` models use Gemini 3 level-based thinking config instead of budget fallback ([#1785](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1785), thanks [@n-WN](https://github.com/n-WN)).
- Fixed browser bundling failures by lazy-loading the Bedrock provider and removing Node-only side effects from the default browser import graph ([#1814](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1814)).
- Fixed `ERR_VM_DYNAMIC_IMPORT_CALLBACK_MISSING` failures by replacing `Function`-based dynamic imports with module dynamic imports in browser-safe provider loading paths ([#1814](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1814)).
- Fixed Bedrock region resolution for `AWS_PROFILE` by honoring `region` from the selected profile when present ([#1800](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1800)).
- Fixed Groq Qwen3 reasoning effort mapping by translating unsupported effort values to provider-supported values ([#1745](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1745)).

## [0.55.3] - 2026-02-27

## [0.55.2] - 2026-02-27

### Fixed

- Restored built-in OAuth providers when unregistering dynamically registered provider IDs and added `resetOAuthProviders()` for registry reset flows.
- Fixed Z.ai thinking control using wrong parameter name (`thinking` instead of `enable_thinking`), causing thinking to always be enabled and wasting tokens/latency ([#1674](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1674) by [@okuyam2y](https://github.com/okuyam2y))
- Fixed `redacted_thinking` blocks being silently dropped during Anthropic streaming. They are now captured as `ThinkingContent` with `redacted: true`, passed back to the API in multi-turn conversations, and handled in cross-model message transformation ([#1665](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1665) by [@tctev](https://github.com/tctev))
- Fixed `interleaved-thinking-2025-05-14` beta header being sent for adaptive thinking models (Opus 4.6, Sonnet 4.6) where the header is deprecated or redundant ([#1665](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1665) by [@tctev](https://github.com/tctev))
- Fixed temperature being sent alongside extended thinking, which is incompatible with both adaptive and budget-based thinking modes ([#1665](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1665) by [@tctev](https://github.com/tctev))
- Fixed `(external, cli)` user-agent flag causing 401 errors on Anthropic setup-token endpoint ([#1677](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1677) by [@LazerLance777](https://github.com/LazerLance777))
- Fixed crash when OpenAI-compatible provider returns a chunk with no `choices` array by adding optional chaining ([#1671](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1671))

## [0.55.1] - 2026-02-26

### Added

- Added WebSocket transport support for OpenAI Codex Responses (`openai-codex-responses`).

### Changed

- OpenAI Codex Responses now defaults to SSE transport unless `transport` is explicitly set.
- OpenAI Codex Responses WebSocket connections are cached per `sessionId` and expire after 5 minutes of inactivity.

## [0.52.11] - 2026-02-13

### Added

- Added MiniMax M2.5 model entries for `minimax`, `minimax-cn`, `openrouter`, and `vercel-ai-gateway` providers, plus `minimax-m2.5-free` for `opencode`.

### Changed

- Updated the Antigravity system instruction to a more compact version for Google Gemini CLI compatibility

### Fixed

- Use `parametersJsonSchema` for Google provider tool declarations to support full JSON Schema (anyOf, oneOf, const, etc.) ([#1398](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1398) by [@jarib](https://github.com/jarib))
- Reverted incorrect Antigravity model change: `claude-opus-4-6-thinking` back to `claude-opus-4-5-thinking` (model doesn't exist on Antigravity endpoint)
- Corrected opencode context windows for Claude Sonnet 4 and 4.5 ([#1383](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1383))

## [0.52.8] - 2026-02-07

### Fixed

- Set OpenAI Responses API requests to `store: false` by default to avoid server-side history logging ([#1308](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1308))
- Re-exported TypeBox `Type`, `Static`, and `TSchema` from `@mariozechner/pi-ai` to match documentation and avoid duplicate TypeBox type identity issues in pnpm setups ([#1338](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1338))
- Fixed Bedrock adaptive thinking handling for Claude Opus 4.6 with interleaved thinking beta responses ([#1323](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1323) by [@markusylisiurunen](https://github.com/markusylisiurunen))
- Fixed `AWS_BEDROCK_SKIP_AUTH` environment detection to avoid `process` access in non-Node.js environments

## [0.52.6] - 2026-02-05

## [0.52.5] - 2026-02-05

### Fixed

- Fixed `supportsXhigh()` to treat Anthropic Messages Opus 4.6 models as xhigh-capable so `streamSimple` can map `xhigh` to adaptive effort `max`

### Added

- Added adaptive thinking support for Claude Opus 4.6 with effort levels (`low`, `medium`, `high`, `max`)
- Added `effort` option to `AnthropicOptions` for controlling adaptive thinking depth
- `thinkingEnabled` now automatically uses adaptive thinking for Opus 4.6+ models and budget-based thinking for older models
- `streamSimple`/`completeSimple` automatically map `ThinkingLevel` to effort levels for Opus 4.6

- Added GPT-5.3 Codex model to the generated model catalog (OpenAI Codex provider only)

## [0.51.6] - 2026-02-04

### Fixed

- Fixed OpenAI Codex Responses provider to respect configured baseUrl ([#1244](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1244))

## [0.51.5] - 2026-02-04

### Changed

- Changed Bedrock model generation to drop legacy workarounds now handled upstream ([#1239](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1239) by [@unexge](https://github.com/unexge))

## [0.51.4] - 2026-02-03

## [0.51.3] - 2026-02-03

### Fixed

- Fixed xhigh thinking level support check to accept gpt-5.2 model IDs ([#1209](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1209))

## [0.51.2] - 2026-02-03

## [0.51.1] - 2026-02-02

### Fixed

- Fixed `cache_control` not being applied to string-format user messages in Anthropic provider

## [0.51.0] - 2026-02-01

### Fixed

- Fixed `cacheRetention` option not being passed through in `buildBaseOptions` ([#1154](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1154))
- Fixed OAuth login/refresh not using HTTP proxy settings (`HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY` env vars) ([#1132](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1132))
- Fixed OpenAI-compatible completions to omit unsupported `strict` tool fields for providers that reject them ([#1172](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1172))

## [0.50.9] - 2026-02-01

### Added

- Added `PI_AI_ANTIGRAVITY_VERSION` environment variable to override the Antigravity User-Agent version when Google updates their version requirements ([#1129](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1129))
- Added `cacheRetention` stream option with provider-specific mappings for prompt cache controls, defaulting to short retention ([#1134](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1134))

## [0.50.8] - 2026-02-01

### Added

- Added `maxRetryDelayMs` option to `StreamOptions` to cap server-requested retry delays. When a provider (e.g., Google Gemini CLI) requests a delay longer than this value, the request fails immediately with an informative error instead of waiting silently. Default: 60000ms (60 seconds). Set to 0 to disable the cap. ([#1123](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1123))
- Added Qwen thinking format support for OpenAI-compatible completions via `enable_thinking`. ([#940](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/940) by [@4h9fbZ](https://github.com/4h9fbZ))

## [0.50.7] - 2026-01-31

## [0.50.5] - 2026-01-30

## [0.50.4] - 2026-01-30

### Added

- Added Vercel AI Gateway routing support via `vercelGatewayRouting` option in model config ([#1051](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1051) by [@ben-vargas](https://github.com/ben-vargas))

### Fixed

- Updated Antigravity User-Agent from 1.11.5 to 1.15.8 to fix rejected requests ([#1079](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1079))
- Fixed tool call argument defaults for Anthropic and Google history conversion when providers omit inputs ([#1065](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1065))

### Added

- Added Kimi For Coding provider support (Moonshot AI's Anthropic-compatible coding API)

## [0.50.2] - 2026-01-29

### Added

- Added Hugging Face provider support via OpenAI-compatible Inference Router ([#994](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/994))
- Added `PI_CACHE_RETENTION` environment variable to control cache TTL for Anthropic (5m vs 1h) and OpenAI (in-memory vs 24h). Set to `long` for extended retention. Only applies to direct API calls (api.anthropic.com, api.openai.com). ([#967](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/967))

### Fixed

- Fixed OpenAI completions `toolChoice` handling to correctly set `type: "function"` wrapper ([#998](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/998) by [@williamtwomey](https://github.com/williamtwomey))
- Fixed cross-provider handoff failing when switching from OpenAI Responses API providers (github-copilot, openai-codex) to other providers due to pipe-separated tool call IDs not being normalized, and trailing underscores in truncated IDs being rejected by OpenAI Codex ([#1022](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1022))
- Fixed 429 rate limit errors incorrectly triggering auto-compaction instead of retry with backoff ([#1038](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1038))
- Fixed Anthropic provider to handle `sensitive` stop_reason returned by API ([#978](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/978))
- Fixed DeepSeek API compatibility by detecting `deepseek.com` URLs and disabling unsupported `developer` role ([#1048](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1048))
- Fixed Anthropic provider to preserve input token counts when proxies omit them in `message_delta` events ([#1045](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1045))

## [0.50.1] - 2026-01-26

### Fixed

- Fixed OpenCode Zen model generation to exclude deprecated models ([#970](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/970) by [@DanielTatarkin](https://github.com/DanielTatarkin))

## [0.50.0] - 2026-01-26

### Added

- Added OpenRouter provider routing support for custom models via `openRouterRouting` compat field ([#859](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/859) by [@v01dpr1mr0s3](https://github.com/v01dpr1mr0s3))
- Added `azure-openai-responses` provider support for Azure OpenAI Responses API. ([#890](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/890) by [@markusylisiurunen](https://github.com/markusylisiurunen))
- Added HTTP proxy environment variable support for API requests ([#942](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/942) by [@haoqixu](https://github.com/haoqixu))
- Added `createAssistantMessageEventStream()` factory function for use in extensions.

- Moved environment API key resolution to `env-api-keys.ts` and re-exported it from the package entrypoint.
- Azure OpenAI Responses provider now uses base URL configuration with deployment-aware model mapping and no longer includes service tier handling.

### Fixed

- Fixed Bun runtime detection for dynamic imports in browser-compatible modules (stream.ts, openai-codex-responses.ts, openai-codex.ts) ([#922](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/922) by [@dannote](https://github.com/dannote))
- Fixed streaming functions to use `model.api` instead of hardcoded API types
- Fixed Google providers to default tool call arguments to an empty object when omitted
- Fixed OpenAI Responses streaming to handle `arguments.done` events on OpenAI-compatible endpoints ([#917](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/917) by [@williballenthin](https://github.com/williballenthin))
- Fixed OpenAI Codex Responses tool strictness handling after the shared responses refactor
- Fixed Azure OpenAI Responses streaming to guard deltas before content parts and correct metadata and handoff gating
- Fixed OpenAI completions tool-result image batching after consecutive tool results ([#902](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/902) by [@terrorobe](https://github.com/terrorobe))

## [0.49.3] - 2026-01-22

### Added

- Added `headers` option to `StreamOptions` for custom HTTP headers in API requests. Supported by all providers except Amazon Bedrock (which uses AWS SDK auth). Headers are merged with provider defaults and `model.headers`, with `options.headers` taking precedence.
- Added `originator` option to `loginOpenAICodex()` for custom OAuth client identification
- Browser compatibility for pi-ai: replaced top-level Node.js imports with dynamic imports for browser environments ([#873](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/873))

### Fixed

- Fixed OpenAI Responses API 400 error "function_call without required reasoning item" when switching between models (same provider, different model). The fix omits the `id` field for function_calls from different models to avoid triggering OpenAI's reasoning/function_call pairing validation ([#886](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/886))

## [0.49.2] - 2026-01-19

### Added

- Added AWS credential detection for ECS/Kubernetes environments: `AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_RELATIVE_URI`, `AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_FULL_URI`, `AWS_WEB_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE` ([#848](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/848))

### Fixed

- Fixed OpenAI Responses 400 error "reasoning without following item" by skipping errored/aborted assistant messages entirely in transform-messages.ts ([#838](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/838))

### Removed

- Removed `strictResponsesPairing` compat option (no longer needed after the transform-messages fix)

## [0.49.1] - 2026-01-18

### Added

- Added `OpenAIResponsesCompat` interface with `strictResponsesPairing` option for Azure OpenAI Responses API, which requires strict reasoning/message pairing in history replay ([#768](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/768) by [@prateekmedia](https://github.com/prateekmedia))

### Changed

- Split `OpenAICompat` into `OpenAICompletionsCompat` and `OpenAIResponsesCompat` for type-safe API-specific compat settings

### Fixed

- Fixed tool call ID normalization for cross-provider handoffs (e.g., Codex to Antigravity Claude) ([#821](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/821))

## [0.49.0] - 2026-01-17

### Changed

- OpenAI Codex responses now use the context system prompt directly in the instructions field.

### Fixed

- Fixed orphaned tool results after errored assistant messages causing Codex API errors. When an assistant message has `stopReason: "error"`, its tool calls are now excluded from pending tool tracking, preventing synthetic tool results from being generated for calls that will be dropped by provider-specific converters. ([#812](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/812))
- Fixed Bedrock Claude max_tokens handling to always exceed thinking budget tokens, preventing compaction failures. ([#797](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/797) by [@pjtf93](https://github.com/pjtf93))
- Fixed Claude Code tool name normalization to match the Claude Code tool list case-insensitively and remove invalid mappings.

## [0.48.0] - 2026-01-16

### Fixed

- Fixed OpenAI-compatible provider feature detection to use `model.provider` in addition to URL, allowing custom base URLs (e.g., proxies) to work correctly with provider-specific settings ([#774](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/774))
- Fixed Gemini 3 context loss when switching from providers without thought signatures: unsigned tool calls are now converted to text with anti-mimicry notes instead of being skipped
- Fixed string numbers in tool arguments not being coerced to numbers during validation ([#786](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/786) by [@dannote](https://github.com/dannote))
- Fixed Bedrock tool call IDs to use only alphanumeric characters, avoiding API errors from invalid characters ([#781](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/781) by [@pjtf93](https://github.com/pjtf93))
- Fixed empty error assistant messages (from 429/500 errors) breaking the tool_use to tool_result chain by filtering them in `transformMessages`

## [0.47.0] - 2026-01-16

### Fixed

- Fixed OpenCode provider's `/v1` endpoint to use `system` role instead of `developer` role, fixing `400 Incorrect role information` error for models using `openai-completions` API ([#755](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/755) by [@melihmucuk](https://github.com/melihmucuk))
- Added retry logic to OpenAI Codex provider for transient errors (429, 5xx, connection failures). Uses exponential backoff with up to 3 retries. ([#733](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/733))

## [0.46.0] - 2026-01-15

### Added

- Added MiniMax China (`minimax-cn`) provider support ([#725](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/725) by [@tallshort](https://github.com/tallshort))
- Added `gpt-5.2-codex` models for GitHub Copilot and OpenCode Zen providers ([#734](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/734) by [@aadishv](https://github.com/aadishv))

### Fixed

- Avoid unsigned Gemini 3 tool calls ([#741](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/741) by [@roshanasingh4](https://github.com/roshanasingh4))
- Fixed signature support for non-Anthropic models in Amazon Bedrock provider ([#727](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/727) by [@unexge](https://github.com/unexge))

## [0.45.7] - 2026-01-13

### Fixed

- Fixed OpenAI Responses timeout option handling ([#706](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/706) by [@markusylisiurunen](https://github.com/markusylisiurunen))
- Fixed Bedrock tool call conversion to apply message transforms ([#707](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/707) by [@pjtf93](https://github.com/pjtf93))

## [0.45.6] - 2026-01-13

### Fixed

- Export `parseStreamingJson` from main package for tsx dev mode compatibility

## [0.45.5] - 2026-01-13

## [0.45.4] - 2026-01-13

### Added

- Added Vercel AI Gateway provider with model discovery and `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` env support ([#689](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/689) by [@timolins](https://github.com/timolins))

### Fixed

- Fixed z.ai thinking/reasoning: z.ai uses `thinking: { type: "enabled" }` instead of OpenAI's `reasoning_effort`. Added `thinkingFormat` compat flag to handle this. ([#688](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/688))

## [0.45.3] - 2026-01-13

## [0.45.2] - 2026-01-13

## [0.45.1] - 2026-01-13

## [0.45.0] - 2026-01-13

### Added

- MiniMax provider support with M2 and M2.1 models via Anthropic-compatible API ([#656](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/656) by [@dannote](https://github.com/dannote))
- Add Amazon Bedrock provider with prompt caching for Claude models (experimental, tested with Anthropic Claude models only) ([#494](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/494) by [@unexge](https://github.com/unexge))
- Added `serviceTier` option for OpenAI Responses requests ([#672](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/672) by [@markusylisiurunen](https://github.com/markusylisiurunen))
- **Anthropic caching on OpenRouter**: Interactions with Anthropic models via OpenRouter now set a 5-minute cache point using Anthropic-style `cache_control` breakpoints on the last assistant or user message. ([#584](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/584) by [@nathyong](https://github.com/nathyong))
- **Google Gemini CLI provider improvements**: Added Antigravity endpoint fallback (tries daily sandbox then prod when `baseUrl` is unset), header-based retry delay parsing (`Retry-After`, `x-ratelimit-reset`, `x-ratelimit-reset-after`), stable `sessionId` derivation from first user message for cache affinity, empty SSE stream retry with backoff, and `anthropic-beta` header for Claude thinking models ([#670](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/670) by [@kim0](https://github.com/kim0))

## [0.44.0] - 2026-01-12

## [0.43.0] - 2026-01-11

### Fixed

- Fixed Google provider thinking detection: `isThinkingPart()` now only checks `thought === true`, not `thoughtSignature`. Per Google docs, `thoughtSignature` is for context replay and can appear on any part type. Also removed `id` field from `functionCall`/`functionResponse` (rejected by Vertex AI and Cloud Code Assist), and added `textSignature` round-trip for multi-turn reasoning context. ([#631](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/631) by [@theBucky](https://github.com/theBucky))

## [0.42.5] - 2026-01-11

## [0.42.4] - 2026-01-10

## [0.42.3] - 2026-01-10

### Changed

- OpenAI Codex: switched to bundled system prompt matching opencode, changed originator to "pi", simplified prompt handling

## [0.42.2] - 2026-01-10

### Added

- Added `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` env var support for Vertex AI credential detection (standard for CI/production).
- Added `supportsUsageInStreaming` compatibility flag for OpenAI-compatible providers that reject `stream_options: { include_usage: true }`. Defaults to `true`. Set to `false` in model config for providers like gatewayz.ai. ([#596](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/596) by [@XesGaDeus](https://github.com/XesGaDeus))
- Improved Google model pricing info ([#588](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/588) by [@aadishv](https://github.com/aadishv))

### Fixed

- Fixed `os.homedir()` calls at module load time; now resolved lazily when needed.
- Fixed OpenAI Responses tool strict flag to use a boolean for LM Studio compatibility ([#598](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/598) by [@gnattu](https://github.com/gnattu))
- Fixed Google Cloud Code Assist OAuth for paid subscriptions: properly handles long-running operations for project provisioning, supports `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` / `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID` env vars for paid tiers, and handles VPC-SC affected users ([#582](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/582) by [@cmf](https://github.com/cmf))

## [0.42.1] - 2026-01-09

## [0.42.0] - 2026-01-09

### Added

- Added OpenCode Zen provider support with 26 models (Claude, GPT, Gemini, Grok, Kimi, GLM, Qwen, etc.). Set `OPENCODE_API_KEY` env var to use.

## [0.41.0] - 2026-01-09

## [0.40.1] - 2026-01-09

## [0.40.0] - 2026-01-08

## [0.39.1] - 2026-01-08

## [0.39.0] - 2026-01-08

### Fixed

- Fixed Gemini CLI abort handling: detect native `AbortError` in retry catch block, cancel SSE reader when abort signal fires ([#568](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/568) by [@tmustier](https://github.com/tmustier))
- Fixed Antigravity provider 429 errors by aligning request payload with CLIProxyAPI v6.6.89: inject Antigravity system instruction with `role: "user"`, set `requestType: "agent"`, and use `antigravity` userAgent. Added bridge prompt to override Antigravity behavior (identity, paths, web dev guidelines) with Pi defaults. ([#571](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/571) by [@ben-vargas](https://github.com/ben-vargas))
- Fixed thinking block handling for cross-model conversations: thinking blocks are now converted to plain text (no `<thinking>` tags) when switching models. Previously, `<thinking>` tags caused models to mimic the pattern and output literal tags. Also fixed empty thinking blocks causing API errors. ([#561](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/561))

## [0.38.0] - 2026-01-08

### Added

- `thinkingBudgets` option in `SimpleStreamOptions` for customizing token budgets per thinking level on token-based providers ([#529](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/529) by [@melihmucuk](https://github.com/melihmucuk))

### Breaking Changes

- Removed OpenAI Codex model aliases (`gpt-5`, `gpt-5-mini`, `gpt-5-nano`, `codex-mini-latest`, `gpt-5-codex`, `gpt-5.1-codex`, `gpt-5.1-chat-latest`). Use canonical model IDs: `gpt-5.1`, `gpt-5.1-codex-max`, `gpt-5.1-codex-mini`, `gpt-5.2`, `gpt-5.2-codex`. ([#536](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/536) by [@ghoulr](https://github.com/ghoulr))

### Fixed

- Fixed OpenAI Codex context window from 400,000 to 272,000 tokens to match Codex CLI defaults and prevent 400 errors. ([#536](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/536) by [@ghoulr](https://github.com/ghoulr))
- Fixed Codex SSE error events to surface message, code, and status. ([#551](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/551) by [@tmustier](https://github.com/tmustier))
- Fixed context overflow detection for `context_length_exceeded` error codes.

## [0.37.8] - 2026-01-07

## [0.37.7] - 2026-01-07

## [0.37.6] - 2026-01-06

### Added

- Exported OpenAI Codex utilities: `CacheMetadata`, `getCodexInstructions`, `getModelFamily`, `ModelFamily`, `buildCodexPiBridge`, `buildCodexSystemPrompt`, `CodexSystemPrompt` ([#510](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/510) by [@mitsuhiko](https://github.com/mitsuhiko))

## [0.37.5] - 2026-01-06

## [0.37.4] - 2026-01-06

## [0.37.3] - 2026-01-06

### Added

- `sessionId` option in `StreamOptions` for providers that support session-based caching. OpenAI Codex provider uses this to set `prompt_cache_key` and routing headers.

## [0.37.2] - 2026-01-05

### Fixed

- Codex provider now always includes `reasoning.encrypted_content` even when custom `include` options are passed ([#484](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/484) by [@kim0](https://github.com/kim0))

## [0.37.1] - 2026-01-05

## [0.37.0] - 2026-01-05

### Breaking Changes

- OpenAI Codex models no longer have per-thinking-level variants (e.g., `gpt-5.2-codex-high`). Use the base model ID and set thinking level separately. The Codex provider clamps reasoning effort to what each model supports internally. (initial implementation by [@ben-vargas](https://github.com/ben-vargas) in [#472](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/472))

### Added

- Headless OAuth support for all callback-server providers (Google Gemini CLI, Antigravity, OpenAI Codex): paste redirect URL when browser callback is unreachable ([#428](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/428) by [@ben-vargas](https://github.com/ben-vargas), [#468](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/468) by [@crcatala](https://github.com/crcatala))
- Cancellable GitHub Copilot device code polling via AbortSignal

### Fixed

- Codex requests now omit the `reasoning` field entirely when thinking is off, letting the backend use its default instead of forcing a value. ([#472](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/472))

## [0.36.0] - 2026-01-05

### Added

- OpenAI Codex OAuth provider with Responses API streaming support: `openai-codex-responses` streaming provider with SSE parsing, tool-call handling, usage/cost tracking, and PKCE OAuth flow ([#451](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/451) by [@kim0](https://github.com/kim0))

### Fixed

- Vertex AI dummy value for `getEnvApiKey()`: Returns `"<authenticated>"` when Application Default Credentials are configured (`~/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json` exists) and both `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` (or `GCLOUD_PROJECT`) and `GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION` are set. This allows `streamSimple()` to work with Vertex AI without explicit `apiKey` option. The ADC credentials file existence check is cached per-process to avoid repeated filesystem access.

## [0.35.0] - 2026-01-05

## [0.34.2] - 2026-01-04

## [0.34.1] - 2026-01-04

## [0.33.0] - 2026-01-04

## [0.32.3] - 2026-01-03

### Fixed

- Google Vertex AI models no longer appear in available models list without explicit authentication. Previously, `getEnvApiKey()` returned a dummy value for `google-vertex`, causing models to show up even when Google Cloud ADC was not configured.

## [0.32.2] - 2026-01-03

## [0.32.1] - 2026-01-03

## [0.32.0] - 2026-01-03

### Added

- Vertex AI provider with ADC (Application Default Credentials) support. Authenticate with `gcloud auth application-default login`, set `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` and `GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION`, and access Gemini models via Vertex AI. ([#300](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/300) by [@default-anton](https://github.com/default-anton))

### Fixed

- **Gemini CLI rate limit handling**: Added automatic retry with server-provided delay for 429 errors. Parses delay from error messages like "Your quota will reset after 39s" and waits accordingly. Falls back to exponential backoff for other transient errors. ([#370](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/370))

## [0.31.1] - 2026-01-02

## [0.31.0] - 2026-01-02

### Breaking Changes

- **Agent API moved**: All agent functionality (`agentLoop`, `agentLoopContinue`, `AgentContext`, `AgentEvent`, `AgentTool`, `AgentToolResult`, etc.) has moved to `@mariozechner/pi-agent-core`. Import from that package instead of `@mariozechner/pi-ai`.

### Added

- **`GoogleThinkingLevel` type**: Exported type that mirrors Google's `ThinkingLevel` enum values (`"THINKING_LEVEL_UNSPECIFIED" | "MINIMAL" | "LOW" | "MEDIUM" | "HIGH"`). Allows configuring Gemini thinking levels without importing from `@google/genai`.
- **`ANTHROPIC_OAUTH_TOKEN` env var**: Now checked before `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in `getEnvApiKey()`, allowing OAuth tokens to take precedence.
- **`event-stream.js` export**: `AssistantMessageEventStream` utility now exported from package index.

### Changed

- **OAuth uses Web Crypto API**: PKCE generation and OAuth flows now use Web Crypto API (`crypto.subtle`) instead of Node.js `crypto` module. This improves browser compatibility while still working in Node.js 20+.
- **Deterministic model generation**: `generate-models.ts` now sorts providers and models alphabetically for consistent output across runs. ([#332](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/332) by [@mrexodia](https://github.com/mrexodia))

### Fixed

- **OpenAI completions empty content blocks**: Empty text or thinking blocks in assistant messages are now filtered out before sending to the OpenAI completions API, preventing validation errors. ([#344](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/344) by [@default-anton](https://github.com/default-anton))
- **Thinking token duplication**: Fixed thinking content duplication with chutes.ai provider. The provider was returning thinking content in both `reasoning_content` and `reasoning` fields, causing each chunk to be processed twice. Now only the first non-empty reasoning field is used.
- **zAi provider API mapping**: Fixed zAi models to use `openai-completions` API with correct base URL (`https://api.z.ai/api/coding/paas/v4`) instead of incorrect Anthropic API mapping. ([#344](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/344), [#358](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/358) by [@default-anton](https://github.com/default-anton))

## [0.28.0] - 2025-12-25

### Breaking Changes

- **OAuth storage removed** ([#296](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/296)): All storage functions (`loadOAuthCredentials`, `saveOAuthCredentials`, `setOAuthStorage`, etc.) removed. Callers are responsible for storing credentials.
- **OAuth login functions**: `loginAnthropic`, `loginGitHubCopilot`, `loginGeminiCli`, `loginAntigravity` now return `OAuthCredentials` instead of saving to disk.
- **refreshOAuthToken**: Now takes `(provider, credentials)` and returns new `OAuthCredentials` instead of saving.
- **getOAuthApiKey**: Now takes `(provider, credentials)` and returns `{ newCredentials, apiKey }` or null.
- **OAuthCredentials type**: No longer includes `type: "oauth"` discriminator. Callers add discriminator when storing.
- **setApiKey, resolveApiKey**: Removed. Callers must manage their own API key storage/resolution.
- **getApiKey**: Renamed to `getEnvApiKey`. Only checks environment variables for known providers.

## [0.27.7] - 2025-12-24

### Fixed

- **Thinking tag leakage**: Fixed Claude mimicking literal `</thinking>` tags in responses. Unsigned thinking blocks (from aborted streams) are now converted to plain text without `<thinking>` tags. The TUI still displays them as thinking blocks. ([#302](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/302) by [@nicobailon](https://github.com/nicobailon))

## [0.25.1] - 2025-12-21

### Added

- **xhigh thinking level support**: Added `supportsXhigh()` function to check if a model supports xhigh reasoning level. Also clamps xhigh to high for OpenAI models that don't support it. ([#236](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/236) by [@theBucky](https://github.com/theBucky))

### Fixed

- **Gemini multimodal tool results**: Fixed images in tool results causing flaky/broken responses with Gemini models. For Gemini 3, images are now nested inside `functionResponse.parts` per the [docs](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/function-calling#multimodal). For older models (which don't support multimodal function responses), images are sent in a separate user message.

- **Queued message steering**: When `getQueuedMessages` is provided, the agent loop now checks for queued user messages after each tool call and skips remaining tool calls in the current assistant message when a queued message arrives (emitting error tool results).

- **Double API version path in Google provider URL**: Fixed Gemini API calls returning 404 after baseUrl support was added. The SDK was appending its default apiVersion to baseUrl which already included the version path. ([#251](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/251) by [@shellfyred](https://github.com/shellfyred))

- **Anthropic SDK retries disabled**: Re-enabled SDK-level retries (default 2) for transient HTTP failures. ([#252](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/252))

## [0.23.5] - 2025-12-19

### Added

- **Gemini 3 Flash thinking support**: Extended thinking level support for Gemini 3 Flash models (MINIMAL, LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH) to match Pro models' capabilities. ([#212](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/212) by [@markusylisiurunen](https://github.com/markusylisiurunen))

- **GitHub Copilot thinking models**: Added thinking support for additional Copilot models (o3-mini, o1-mini, o1-preview). ([#234](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/234) by [@aadishv](https://github.com/aadishv))

### Fixed

- **Gemini tool result format**: Fixed tool result format for Gemini 3 Flash Preview which strictly requires `{ output: value }` for success and `{ error: value }` for errors. Previous format using `{ result, isError }` was rejected by newer Gemini models. Also improved type safety by removing `as any` casts. ([#213](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/213), [#220](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/220))

- **Google baseUrl configuration**: Google provider now respects `baseUrl` configuration for custom endpoints or API proxies. ([#216](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/216), [#221](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/221) by [@theBucky](https://github.com/theBucky))

- **GitHub Copilot vision requests**: Added `Copilot-Vision-Request` header when sending images to GitHub Copilot models. ([#222](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/222))

- **GitHub Copilot X-Initiator header**: Fixed X-Initiator logic to check last message role instead of any message in history. This ensures proper billing when users send follow-up messages. ([#209](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/209))

## [0.22.3] - 2025-12-16

### Added

- **Image limits test suite**: Added comprehensive tests for provider-specific image limitations (max images, max size, max dimensions). Discovered actual limits: Anthropic (100 images, 5MB, 8000px), OpenAI (500 images, ≥25MB), Gemini (~2500 images, ≥40MB), Mistral (8 images, ~15MB), OpenRouter (~40 images context-limited, ~15MB). ([#120](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/120))

- **Tool result streaming**: Added `tool_execution_update` event and optional `onUpdate` callback to `AgentTool.execute()` for streaming tool output during execution. Tools can now emit partial results (e.g., bash stdout) that are forwarded to subscribers. ([#44](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/44))

- **X-Initiator header for GitHub Copilot**: Added X-Initiator header handling for GitHub Copilot provider to ensure correct call accounting (agent calls are not deducted from quota). Sets initiator based on last message role. ([#200](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/200) by [@kim0](https://github.com/kim0))

### Changed

- **Normalized tool_execution_end result**: `tool_execution_end` event now always contains `AgentToolResult` (no longer `AgentToolResult | string`). Errors are wrapped in the standard result format.

### Fixed

- **Reasoning disabled by default**: When `reasoning` option is not specified, thinking is now explicitly disabled for all providers. Previously, some providers like Gemini with "dynamic thinking" would use their default (thinking ON), causing unexpected token usage. This was the original intended behavior. ([#180](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/180) by [@markusylisiurunen](https://github.com/markusylisiurunen))

## [0.22.2] - 2025-12-15

### Added

- **Interleaved thinking for Anthropic**: Added `interleavedThinking` option to `AnthropicOptions`. When enabled, Claude 4 models can think between tool calls and reason after receiving tool results. Enabled by default (no extra token cost, just unlocks the capability). Set `interleavedThinking: false` to disable.

## [0.22.1] - 2025-12-15

_Dedicated to Peter's shoulder ([@steipete](https://twitter.com/steipete))_

### Added

- **Interleaved thinking for Anthropic**: Enabled interleaved thinking in the Anthropic provider, allowing Claude models to output thinking blocks interspersed with text responses.

## [0.22.0] - 2025-12-15

### Added

- **GitHub Copilot provider**: Added `github-copilot` as a known provider with models sourced from models.dev. Includes Claude, GPT, Gemini, Grok, and other models available through GitHub Copilot. ([#191](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/191) by [@cau1k](https://github.com/cau1k))

### Fixed

- **GitHub Copilot gpt-5 models**: Fixed API selection for gpt-5 models to use `openai-responses` instead of `openai-completions` (gpt-5 models are not accessible via completions endpoint)

- **GitHub Copilot cross-model context handoff**: Fixed context handoff failing when switching between GitHub Copilot models using different APIs (e.g., gpt-5 to claude-sonnet-4). Tool call IDs from OpenAI Responses API were incompatible with other models. ([#198](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/198))

- **Gemini 3 Pro thinking levels**: Thinking level configuration now works correctly for Gemini 3 Pro models. Previously all levels mapped to -1 (minimal thinking). Now LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH properly control test-time computation. ([#176](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/176) by [@markusylisiurunen](https://github.com/markusylisiurunen))

## [0.18.2] - 2025-12-11

### Changed

- **Anthropic SDK retries disabled**: Set `maxRetries: 0` on Anthropic client to allow application-level retry handling. The SDK's built-in retries were interfering with coding-agent's retry logic. ([#157](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/157))

## [0.18.1] - 2025-12-10

### Added

- **Mistral provider**: Added support for Mistral AI models via the OpenAI-compatible API. Includes automatic handling of Mistral-specific requirements (tool call ID format). Set `MISTRAL_API_KEY` environment variable to use.

### Fixed

- Fixed Mistral 400 errors after aborted assistant messages by skipping empty assistant messages (no content, no tool calls) ([#165](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/165))

- Removed synthetic assistant bridge message after tool results for Mistral (no longer required as of Dec 2025) ([#165](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/165))

- Fixed bug where `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable was deleted globally after first OAuth token usage, causing subsequent prompts to fail ([#164](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/164))

## [0.17.0] - 2025-12-09

### Added

- **`agentLoopContinue` function**: Continue an agent loop from existing context without adding a new user message. Validates that the last message is `user` or `toolResult`. Useful for retry after context overflow or resuming from manually-added tool results.

### Breaking Changes

- Removed provider-level tool argument validation. Validation now happens in `agentLoop` via `executeToolCalls`, allowing models to retry on validation errors. For manual tool execution, use `validateToolCall(tools, toolCall)` or `validateToolArguments(tool, toolCall)`.

### Added

- Added `validateToolCall(tools, toolCall)` helper that finds the tool by name and validates arguments.

- **OpenAI compatibility overrides**: Added `compat` field to `Model` for `openai-completions` API, allowing explicit configuration of provider quirks (`supportsStore`, `supportsDeveloperRole`, `supportsReasoningEffort`, `maxTokensField`). Falls back to URL-based detection if not set. Useful for LiteLLM, custom proxies, and other non-standard endpoints. ([#133](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/133), thanks @fink-andreas for the initial idea and PR)

- **xhigh reasoning level**: Added `xhigh` to `ReasoningEffort` type for OpenAI codex-max models. For non-OpenAI providers (Anthropic, Google), `xhigh` is automatically mapped to `high`. ([#143](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/143))

### Changed

- **Updated SDK versions**: OpenAI SDK 5.21.0 → 6.10.0, Anthropic SDK 0.61.0 → 0.71.2, Google GenAI SDK 1.30.0 → 1.31.0

## [0.13.0] - 2025-12-06

### Breaking Changes

- **Added `totalTokens` field to `Usage` type**: All code that constructs `Usage` objects must now include the `totalTokens` field. This field represents the total tokens processed by the LLM (input + output + cache). For OpenAI and Google, this uses native API values (`total_tokens`, `totalTokenCount`). For Anthropic, it's computed as `input + output + cacheRead + cacheWrite`.

## [0.12.10] - 2025-12-04

### Added

- Added `gpt-5.1-codex-max` model support

### Fixed

- **OpenAI Token Counting**: Fixed `usage.input` to exclude cached tokens for OpenAI providers. Previously, `input` included cached tokens, causing double-counting when calculating total context size via `input + cacheRead`. Now `input` represents non-cached input tokens across all providers, making `input + output + cacheRead + cacheWrite` the correct formula for total context size.

- **Fixed Claude Opus 4.5 cache pricing** (was 3x too expensive)
  - Corrected cache_read: $1.50 → $0.50 per MTok
  - Corrected cache_write: $18.75 → $6.25 per MTok
  - Added manual override in `scripts/generate-models.ts` until upstream fix is merged
  - Submitted PR to models.dev: https://github.com/sst/models.dev/pull/439

## [0.9.4] - 2025-11-26

Initial release with multi-provider LLM support.
