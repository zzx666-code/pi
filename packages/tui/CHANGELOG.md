## [0.86.0] - 2026-09-19

### Added

- Added bundled asynchronous native clipboard readers for macOS, Windows, and X11 through the exported `getNativeClipboard()` API, replacing the external native clipboard dependency in consumers ([#9163](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/9163)).

### Changed

- Reduced fuzzy search latency for long texts by using native substring search instead of scanning each character in JavaScript ([#9267](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/9267)).

### Fixed

- Fixed LaTeX legacy font switches falling back to raw source, centered `cases` layouts around surrounding equations, and vertically laid out unsupported and nested display scripts ([#8827](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/8827), [#9564](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/9564), [#7929](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/7929)).

## [0.85.1] - 2026-09-05

### Added

- Added five-times-faster mouse wheel scrolling while holding Alt in fullscreen mode ([#9166](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/9166) by [@xl0](https://github.com/xl0)).

## [0.85.0] - 2026-09-04

### Breaking Changes

- Removed coding-agent environment-variable defaults from pi-tui. Applications must configure the hardware cursor and clear-on-shrink behavior through the renderer constructor and `setClearOnShrink()`. `PI_DEBUG_REDRAW` is now `PI_TUI_DEBUG_REDRAW`; debug and crash log filenames now use the `pi-tui-` prefix. When no log directory is supplied, redraw logging is disabled and crash dumps are written to the OS temp directory. ([#8699](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/8699) by [@geraschenko](https://github.com/geraschenko))

### Added

- Added a `TuiAltScreen` `scrollToEndIndicator` option that renders a clickable jump-to-end label on a follow-end primary scroll view while it is scrolled away from the end ([#9080](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/9080) by [@rwachtler](https://github.com/rwachtler)).
- Added LaTeX rendering for relational algebra join symbols ([#9050](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/9050) by [@haoqixu](https://github.com/haoqixu)).

- Changed the `Loader` animation and editor integration to support embedded working indicators ([#8799](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/8799) by [@cristinaponcela](https://github.com/cristinaponcela)).
- Reduced fullscreen transcript search latency on large transcripts by caching unchanged search results, indexing ASCII runs, and limiting highlight work to visible matches ([#8800](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/8800) by [@cristinaponcela](https://github.com/cristinaponcela)).

### Fixed

- Fixed drag selection continuing over an editor.
- Fixed terminal startup under restricted seccomp policies that reject the `SIGWINCH` self-signal ([#8898](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/8898) by [@bartlomiejkida](https://github.com/bartlomiejkida)).
- Fixed Zed terminal image capability detection ([#8828](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/8828) by [@Perlence](https://github.com/Perlence)).

## [0.84.4] - 2026-08-28

### Added

- Added environment and programmatic overrides for OSC 8 hyperlinks, inline image protocols, and truecolor terminal capabilities ([#8665](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/8665)).
- Added a `TuiAltScreen` `copyOnSelect` option plus helpers to detect and copy the active fullscreen text selection programmatically ([#7720](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/7720)).

### Changed

- Changed fullscreen scrollbars to render muted thin tracks with contrasting proportional two-cell-minimum thumbs, preserve underlying backgrounds without inheriting foreground styles, reserve an unstyled column in `always` mode, reveal hidden `auto` tracks on pointer entry, expand the same-colored thumb on hover, and support track-click jumping in addition to thumb dragging.
- Changed fullscreen transcript search to use a bordered, placeholder-based input with a muted result count, right-aligned clickable key-and-arrow buttons with configurable hover styling, and open-shortcut toggling.

### Fixed

- Fixed main-screen rendering crashing when image-heavy output exceeded V8's string length limit ([#8028](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/8028)).
- Fixed autocomplete ordering for nested results ([#8669](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/8669)).
- Fixed fullscreen double-click word selection splitting paths and kebab-case tokens on `/` and `-` ([#7746](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/7746)).

## [0.84.3] - 2026-08-24

### Fixed

- Added double-click word and whitespace selection, granularity-aware drag selection, and triple-click paragraph selection in the fullscreen TUI ([#7725](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/7725), [#7733](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/7733) by [@volsa](https://github.com/volsa)).
- Added an optional right-click paste handler to the alternate-screen TUI, currently enabled on Windows.

### Fixed

- Fixed LaTeX relation, multiplication, and named-operator spacing, and correctly composed matrices with stacked fractions, operator limits, and adjacent matrices.
- Reduced fullscreen mouse event volume under tmux, Zellij, and GNU Screen by using button-motion tracking instead of all-motion tracking.

## [0.71.1] - 2026-05-01

## [0.71.0] - 2026-04-30

### Fixed

- Fixed `ProcessTerminal` to fall back to `COLUMNS` and `LINES` before defaulting to 80x24 dimensions ([#4004](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/4004))
- Fixed editor rendering artifacts for Thai Sara Am and Lao AM vowel characters ([#3904](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3904))

## [0.70.5] - 2026-04-27

## [0.70.4] - 2026-04-27

## [0.70.3] - 2026-04-27

### Fixed

- Fixed duplicate printable characters from Kitty keyboard protocol CSI-u plus raw character input on layouts such as Italian ([#3780](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3780))

## [0.70.2] - 2026-04-24

## [0.70.1] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed

- Fixed CSI-u Ctrl+letter decoding inside bracketed paste, so pasted modified-key escape sequences no longer become literal editor text ([#3623](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3623) by [@Exrun94](https://github.com/Exrun94))

## [0.70.0] - 2026-04-23

### Fixed

- Kept OSC 9;4 terminal progress alive with periodic updates so Ghostty does not clear the indicator during long-running agent work ([#3610](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3610))

## [0.69.0] - 2026-04-22

### Added

- Added `setProgress(active: boolean)` to the `Terminal` interface for OSC 9;4 progress indicator support
- Added generic stacked autocomplete support for extension wrappers via `AutocompleteProvider.shouldTriggerFileCompletion?()` and `#` as a natural autocomplete trigger alongside `@` ([#2983](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2983))

## [0.68.1] - 2026-04-22

### Fixed

- Fixed `@` autocomplete fuzzy search to follow symlinked directories and include symlinked paths in results ([#3507](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3507))

## [0.68.0] - 2026-04-20

### Added

- Added `LoaderIndicatorOptions` and `Loader.setIndicator()` support for custom loader frames and animation intervals, allowing TUI consumers to use animated, static, or hidden loader indicators ([#3413](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3413))

### Fixed

- Fixed `@` autocomplete fuzzy search to stop matching against the full base path for plain queries, so worktree or cwd paths containing the query text no longer crowd out real results such as `@plan` suggestions ([#2778](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2778))
- Fixed xterm `modifyOtherKeys` printable input so shifted uppercase letters insert correctly in the editor and shifted letter bindings parse and match consistently ([#3436](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3436))

## [0.67.68] - 2026-04-17

## [0.67.67] - 2026-04-17

## [0.67.6] - 2026-04-16

### Added

- Added OSC 8 hyperlink rendering for markdown links when the terminal advertises support. Introduces a public `hyperlink(text, url)` helper and a `setCapabilities()` test override in `packages/tui` ([#3248](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3248) by [@ofa1](https://github.com/ofa1)).
- Added `argumentHint` to `SlashCommand` interface, displayed before the description in the autocomplete dropdown ([#2780](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2780) by [@andresvi94](https://github.com/andresvi94))

### Changed

- Tightened `detectCapabilities()` to default `hyperlinks: false` for unknown terminals and to force `hyperlinks: false` under tmux/screen (including nested sessions where the outer terminal would otherwise advertise OSC 8). Prevents markdown link URLs from disappearing on terminals that silently swallow OSC 8 sequences ([#3248](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3248)).

## [0.67.5] - 2026-04-16

### Fixed

- Fixed Zellij `Shift+Enter` regressions by reverting the Zellij-specific Kitty keyboard query bypass and restoring the previous keyboard negotiation behavior ([#3259](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3259))

## [0.67.4] - 2026-04-16

### Fixed

- Fixed markdown strikethrough parsing to require strict double-tilde delimiters (`~~text~~`) with non-whitespace boundaries, preventing accidental strikethrough from loose tilde usage.

## [0.67.2] - 2026-04-14

### Added

- Added full helper support for Kitty `super`-modified shortcuts, including combinations such as `super+k`, `super+enter`, and `ctrl+super+k` ([#2979](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2979))

### Fixed

- Fixed Ctrl+Alt letter key matching in tmux by falling through from legacy ESC-prefixed handling to CSI-u and xterm `modifyOtherKeys` parsing when the legacy form does not match ([#2989](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2989) by [@kaofelix](https://github.com/kaofelix))

## [0.67.1] - 2026-04-13

## [0.67.0] - 2026-04-13

### Fixed

- Fixed `Container.render()` stack overflow on long sessions by replacing `Array.push(...spread)` with a loop-based push, preventing `RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded` when child output exceeds the V8 call stack argument limit ([#2651](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2651))
- Fixed editor sticky-column tracking around paste markers so vertical cursor navigation restores the column from before the cursor entered a paste marker instead of jumping inside or past pasted content ([#3092](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3092) by [@Perlence](https://github.com/Perlence))
- Fixed TUI test suite failures caused by render throttle scheduling: added `VirtualTerminal.waitForRender()` helper that waits for the 16ms throttled render pipeline to settle before asserting viewport state ([#3076](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3076) by [@aliou](https://github.com/aliou))

## [0.66.1] - 2026-04-08

## [0.66.0] - 2026-04-08

## [0.65.2] - 2026-04-06

### Fixed

- Fixed render scheduling under heavy streaming output by coalescing `requestRender()` calls to a 16ms frame budget while preserving immediate `requestRender(true)` behavior.

## [0.65.1] - 2026-04-05

## [0.65.0] - 2026-04-03

### Fixed

- Fixed markdown H1 headings ending with inline code from leaking underline styling into trailing line padding
- Fixed slash-command argument autocomplete to await async `getArgumentCompletions()` results and ignore invalid return values, preventing crashes when extension commands provide asynchronous completions ([#2719](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2719))
- Fixed non-capturing overlay padding from inflating scrollback and corrupting the viewport on terminal widen ([#2758](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2758) by [@dotBeeps](https://github.com/dotBeeps))

## [0.64.0] - 2026-03-29

### Fixed

- Fixed TUI cell size response handling to consume only exact `CSI 6 ; height ; width t` replies, so bare `Escape` is no longer swallowed while waiting for terminal image metadata ([#2661](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2661))
- Fixed Kitty keyboard protocol keypad functional keys to normalize to logical digits, symbols, and navigation keys, so numpad input in terminals such as iTerm2 no longer inserts Private Use Area gibberish or gets ignored ([#2650](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2650))

## [0.63.2] - 2026-03-29

## [0.63.1] - 2026-03-27

## [0.63.0] - 2026-03-27

### Added

- Added support for `PI_TUI_WRITE_LOG` directory paths, creating a unique log file (`tui-<timestamp>-<pid>.log`) per instance for easier debugging of multiple pi sessions ([#2508](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2508) by [@mrexodia](https://github.com/mrexodia))

### Fixed

- Fixed blockquote text color breaking after inline links (and other inline elements) due to missing style restoration prefix
- Fixed slash-command Tab completion from immediately chaining into argument autocomplete after completing the command name, restoring flows like `/model` that submit into a selector dialog ([#2577](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2577))
- Fixed stale content and incorrect viewport tracking after TUI content shrinks or transient components inflate the working area ([#2126](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2126) by [@Perlence](https://github.com/Perlence))
- Fixed `@` autocomplete to debounce editor-triggered searches, cancel in-flight `fd` lookups cleanly, and keep suggestions visible while results refresh ([#1278](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1278))


## [0.62.0] - 2026-03-23

### Fixed

- Fixed `truncateToWidth()` to stream truncation for very large strings, keep contiguous prefixes, and always terminate truncated SGR styling safely ([#2447](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2447))
- Fixed markdown heading styling being lost after inline code spans within headings

## [0.61.1] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed

- Fixed shared keybinding resolution to stop user overrides from evicting unrelated default shortcuts such as selector confirm and editor cursor keys ([#2455](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2455))
- Fixed Termux software keyboard height changes from forcing full-screen redraws and replaying TUI history on every toggle ([#2467](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2467))

## [0.61.0] - 2026-03-20

### Breaking Changes

- Replaced the editor-only keybinding store with a single global keybindings manager in `@mariozechner/pi-tui`. TUI keybinding ids are now namespaced: `cursorUp` -> `tui.editor.cursorUp`, `cursorDown` -> `tui.editor.cursorDown`, `cursorLeft` -> `tui.editor.cursorLeft`, `cursorRight` -> `tui.editor.cursorRight`, `cursorWordLeft` -> `tui.editor.cursorWordLeft`, `cursorWordRight` -> `tui.editor.cursorWordRight`, `cursorLineStart` -> `tui.editor.cursorLineStart`, `cursorLineEnd` -> `tui.editor.cursorLineEnd`, `jumpForward` -> `tui.editor.jumpForward`, `jumpBackward` -> `tui.editor.jumpBackward`, `pageUp` -> `tui.editor.pageUp`, `pageDown` -> `tui.editor.pageDown`, `deleteCharBackward` -> `tui.editor.deleteCharBackward`, `deleteCharForward` -> `tui.editor.deleteCharForward`, `deleteWordBackward` -> `tui.editor.deleteWordBackward`, `deleteWordForward` -> `tui.editor.deleteWordForward`, `deleteToLineStart` -> `tui.editor.deleteToLineStart`, `deleteToLineEnd` -> `tui.editor.deleteToLineEnd`, `yank` -> `tui.editor.yank`, `yankPop` -> `tui.editor.yankPop`, `undo` -> `tui.editor.undo`, `newLine` -> `tui.input.newLine`, `submit` -> `tui.input.submit`, `tab` -> `tui.input.tab`, `copy` -> `tui.input.copy`, `selectUp` -> `tui.select.up`, `selectDown` -> `tui.select.down`, `selectPageUp` -> `tui.select.pageUp`, `selectPageDown` -> `tui.select.pageDown`, `selectConfirm` -> `tui.select.confirm`, `selectCancel` -> `tui.select.cancel`. `keybindings.json` stays backward compatible because each keybinding definition maps the new internal id back to the existing public config key. Apps extend `interface Keybindings` via declaration merging, create one manager with both TUI and app definitions, then install it with `setKeybindings(...)` ([#2391](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2391))

### Fixed

- Fixed user-defined keybindings to shadow conflicting default bindings across the shared registry, so app-level defaults no longer stay active when the same key is explicitly reassigned ([#2391](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2391))

## [0.60.0] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed

- Fixed tmux xterm `modifyOtherKeys` matching for `Backspace`, `Escape`, and `Space`, and resolved raw `\x08` backspace ambiguity by treating Windows Terminal sessions differently from legacy terminals ([#2293](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2293))

## [0.59.0] - 2026-03-17

## [0.58.4] - 2026-03-16

## [0.58.3] - 2026-03-15

## [0.58.2] - 2026-03-15

### Added

- Added configurable `SelectList` primary column sizing via `SelectListLayoutOptions`, including custom primary-label truncation hooks ([#2154](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2154) by [@markusylisiurunen](https://github.com/markusylisiurunen))

### Fixed

- Fixed stale scrollback remaining after full-screen redraws such as session switches by clearing the screen before wiping scrollback ([#2155](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2155) by [@Perlence](https://github.com/Perlence))
- Fixed trailing blank lines after markdown block elements when they are followed immediately by the next block or end of document ([#2152](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2152) by [@markusylisiurunen](https://github.com/markusylisiurunen))

## [0.58.1] - 2026-03-14

### Fixed

- Fixed Windows shell and path handling in autocomplete to properly handle drive letters and mixed path separators
- Fixed editor paste to preserve literal content instead of normalizing newlines, preventing content corruption for text with embedded escape sequences ([#2064](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2064))
- Fixed tab completion to preserve `./` prefix when completing relative paths ([#2087](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2087))
- Fixed `ctrl+backspace` being indistinguishable from plain `backspace` on Windows Terminal. `0x08` is now recognized as `ctrl+backspace` instead of `backspace`, making `ctrl+backspace` bindable on terminals where it produces a distinct byte ([#2139](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2139))

## [0.58.0] - 2026-03-14

### Added

- Added paste marker atomic segment handling in editor, treating paste markers as indivisible units during word wrapping and cursor navigation ([#2111](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2111) by [@haoqixu](https://github.com/haoqixu))

### Fixed

- Fixed `Input` horizontal scrolling for wide Unicode text (CJK, fullwidth characters) to use visual column width and strict slice boundaries, preventing rendered line overflow and TUI crashes ([#1982](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1982))
- Fixed xterm `modifyOtherKeys` handling for `Tab` in `matchesKey()`, restoring `shift+tab` and other modified Tab bindings in tmux when `extended-keys-format` is left at the default `xterm`
- Fixed editor scroll indicator rendering crash in narrow terminal widths ([#2103](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2103) by [@haoqixu](https://github.com/haoqixu))
- Fixed tab characters in editor `setText()` and input paths not being normalized to spaces ([#2027](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2027) by [@haoqixu](https://github.com/haoqixu))
- Fixed `wordWrapLine` overflow when wide characters (CJK, fullwidth) fall exactly at the wrap boundary ([#2082](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2082) by [@haoqixu](https://github.com/haoqixu))
- Fixed tab characters in `Input` paste not being normalized to spaces ([#1975](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1975) by [@haoqixu](https://github.com/haoqixu))

## [0.57.1] - 2026-03-07

### Added

- Added `treeFoldOrUp` and `treeUnfoldOrDown` editor actions with default bindings for `Ctrl+←`/`Ctrl+→` and `Alt+←`/`Alt+→` ([#1724](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1724) by [@Perlence](https://github.com/Perlence))
- Added digit keys (`0-9`) to the keybinding system, including Kitty CSI-u and xterm `modifyOtherKeys` support for bindings like `ctrl+1` ([#1905](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1905))

### Fixed

- Fixed autocomplete selection ignoring typed text: highlight now follows the first prefix match as the user types, and exact matches are always selected on Enter ([#1931](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1931) by [@aliou](https://github.com/aliou))
- Fixed xterm `modifyOtherKeys` parsing in `matchesKey()` and `parseKey()`, restoring Ctrl-based keybindings and modified Enter keys in tmux when `extended-keys-format` is left at the default `xterm` ([#1872](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1872))
- Fixed slash-command Tab completion to immediately open argument completions when available ([#1481](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1481) by [@barapa](https://github.com/barapa))

## [0.57.0] - 2026-03-07

### Added

- Added non-capturing overlays via `OverlayOptions.nonCapturing` and new `OverlayHandle` methods: `focus()`, `unfocus()`, and `isFocused()` for programmatic overlay focus control ([#1916](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1916) by [@nicobailon](https://github.com/nicobailon))

### Changed

- Overlay compositing order now uses focus order so focused overlays render on top while preserving stack semantics for show/hide behavior ([#1916](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1916) by [@nicobailon](https://github.com/nicobailon))

### Fixed

- Fixed automatic focus restoration to skip non-capturing overlays and fixed `hideOverlay()` to only reassign focus when the popped overlay had focus ([#1916](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1916) by [@nicobailon](https://github.com/nicobailon))

## [0.56.3] - 2026-03-06

### Added

- Added xterm modifyOtherKeys mode 2 fallback when Kitty keyboard protocol is not available, enabling modified enter keys (Shift+Enter, Ctrl+Enter) inside tmux ([#1872](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1872))

## [0.56.2] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- Exported `decodeKittyPrintable()` from `keys.ts` for decoding Kitty CSI-u sequences into printable characters

### Fixed

- Fixed `Input` component not accepting typed characters when Kitty keyboard protocol is active (e.g., VS Code 1.110+), causing model selector filter to ignore keystrokes ([#1857](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1857))
- Fixed editor/footer visibility drift during terminal resize by forcing full redraws when terminal width or height changes ([#1844](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1844) by [@ghoulr](https://github.com/ghoulr)).

## [0.56.1] - 2026-03-05

### Fixed

- Fixed markdown blockquote rendering to isolate blockquote styling from default text style, preventing style leakage.

## [0.56.0] - 2026-03-04

### Fixed

- Fixed TUI width calculation for regional indicator symbols (e.g. partial flag sequences like `🇨` during streaming) to prevent wrap drift and stale character artifacts in differential rendering.
- Fixed Kitty CSI-u handling to ignore unsupported modifiers so modifier-only events do not insert stray printable characters ([#1807](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1807))
- Fixed single-line paste performance by inserting pasted text atomically instead of character-by-character, preventing repeated `@` autocomplete scans during paste ([#1812](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1812))
- Fixed `visibleWidth()` to ignore generic OSC escape sequences (including OSC 133 semantic prompt markers), preventing width drift when terminals emit semantic zone markers ([#1805](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1805))
- Fixed markdown blockquotes dropping nested list content by rendering blockquote children as block-level tokens ([#1787](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1787))

## [0.55.3] - 2026-02-27

## [0.55.2] - 2026-02-27

## [0.55.1] - 2026-02-26

### Fixed

- Fixed Windows VT input initialization in ESM by loading `koffi` via `createRequire`, restoring VT input mode while keeping `koffi` externalized from compiled binaries ([#1627](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1627) by [@kaste](https://github.com/kaste))

## [0.55.0] - 2026-02-24

## [0.54.2] - 2026-02-23

## [0.54.1] - 2026-02-22

### Fixed

- Changed koffi import from top-level to dynamic require in `enableWindowsVTInput()` to prevent bun from embedding all 18 platform `.node` files (~74MB) into every compiled binary. Koffi is only needed on Windows.

## [0.54.0] - 2026-02-19

## [0.52.11] - 2026-02-13

## [0.52.10] - 2026-02-12

### Added

- Added terminal input listeners in `TUI` (`addInputListener` and `removeInputListener`) to let callers intercept, transform, or consume raw input before component handling.

### Fixed

- Fixed `@` autocomplete fuzzy matching to score against path segments and prefixes, reducing irrelevant matches for nested paths ([#1423](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1423))

## [0.52.9] - 2026-02-08

## [0.52.8] - 2026-02-07

### Added

- Added `pasteToEditor` to `EditorComponent` API for programmatic paste support ([#1351](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1351) by [@kaofelix](https://github.com/kaofelix))
- Added kill ring (ctrl+k/ctrl+y/alt+y) and undo (ctrl+z) support to the Input component ([#1373](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1373) by [@Perlence](https://github.com/Perlence))

## [0.52.7] - 2026-02-06

## [0.52.0] - 2026-02-05

## [0.51.6] - 2026-02-04

### Changed

- Slash command menu now triggers on the first line even when other lines have content, allowing commands to be prepended to existing text ([#1227](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1227) by [@aliou](https://github.com/aliou))

### Fixed

- Fixed `/settings` crashing in narrow terminals by handling small widths in the settings list ([#1246](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1246) by [@haoqixu](https://github.com/haoqixu))

## [0.51.5] - 2026-02-04

## [0.51.4] - 2026-02-03

### Fixed

- Fixed input scrolling to avoid splitting emoji sequences ([#1228](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1228) by [@haoqixu](https://github.com/haoqixu))

## [0.51.3] - 2026-02-03

## [0.51.2] - 2026-02-03

### Added

- Added `Terminal.drainInput()` to drain stdin before exit (prevents Kitty key release events leaking over slow SSH)

### Fixed

- Fixed Kitty key release events leaking to parent shell over slow SSH connections by draining stdin for up to 1s ([#1204](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1204))
- Fixed legacy newline handling in the editor to preserve previous newline behavior
- Fixed @ autocomplete to include hidden paths
- Fixed submit fallback to honor configured keybindings

## [0.51.1] - 2026-02-02

### Added

- Added `PI_DEBUG_REDRAW=1` env var for debugging full redraws (logs triggers to `~/.pi/agent/pi-debug.log`)

### Changed

- Terminal height changes no longer trigger full redraws, reducing flicker on resize
- `clearOnShrink` now defaults to `false` (use `PI_CLEAR_ON_SHRINK=1` or `setClearOnShrink(true)` to enable)

### Fixed

- Fixed emoji cursor positioning in Input component ([#1183](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1183) by [@haoqixu](https://github.com/haoqixu))

- Fixed unnecessary full redraws when appending many lines after content had previously shrunk (viewport check now uses actual previous content size instead of stale maximum)
- Fixed Ctrl+D exit closing the parent SSH session due to stdin buffer race condition ([#1185](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1185))

## [0.51.0] - 2026-02-01

## [0.50.9] - 2026-02-01

## [0.50.8] - 2026-02-01

### Added

- Added sticky column tracking for vertical cursor navigation so the editor restores the preferred column when moving across short lines. ([#1120](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1120) by [@Perlence](https://github.com/Perlence))

### Fixed

- Fixed Kitty keyboard protocol base layout fallback so non-QWERTY layouts do not trigger wrong shortcuts ([#1096](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1096) by [@rytswd](https://github.com/rytswd))

## [0.50.7] - 2026-01-31

## [0.50.6] - 2026-01-30

### Changed

- Optimized `isImageLine()` with `startsWith` short-circuit for faster image line detection

### Fixed

- Fixed empty rows appearing below footer when content shrinks (e.g., closing `/tree`, clearing multi-line editor) ([#1095](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1095) by [@marckrenn](https://github.com/marckrenn))
- Fixed terminal cursor remaining hidden after exiting TUI via `stop()` when a render was pending ([#1099](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1099) by [@haoqixu](https://github.com/haoqixu))

## [0.50.5] - 2026-01-30

### Fixed

- Fixed `isImageLine()` to check for image escape sequences anywhere in a line, not just at the start. This prevents TUI crashes when rendering lines containing image data. ([#1091](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1091) by [@zedrdave](https://github.com/zedrdave))

## [0.50.4] - 2026-01-30

- `truncateToWidth()` now accepts optional `pad` parameter to pad result with spaces to exactly `maxWidth` ([#667](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/667) by [@nicobailon](https://github.com/nicobailon))

### Fixed

- Overlay compositing crash when rendered lines exceed terminal width due to complex ANSI/OSC sequences (e.g., hyperlinks in subagent output) ([#667](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/667) by [@nicobailon](https://github.com/nicobailon))

### Breaking Changes

- **Key detection functions removed**: All `isXxx()` key detection functions (`isEnter()`, `isEscape()`, `isCtrlC()`, etc.) have been removed. Use `matchesKey(data, keyId)` instead (e.g., `matchesKey(data, "enter")`, `matchesKey(data, "ctrl+c")`). This affects hooks and custom tools that use `ctx.ui.custom()` with keyboard input handling. ([#405](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/405))

### Added

- `Editor.insertTextAtCursor(text)` method for programmatic text insertion ([#419](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/419))

### Fixed

- Markdown component now renders HTML tags as plain text instead of silently dropping them ([#359](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/359))
- Crash in `visibleWidth()` and grapheme iteration when encountering undefined code points ([#372](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/372) by [@HACKE-RC](https://github.com/HACKE-RC))
- ZWJ emoji sequences (rainbow flag, family, etc.) now render with correct width instead of being split into multiple characters ([#369](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/369) by [@nathyong](https://github.com/nathyong))

## [0.29.0] - 2025-12-25

### Added

- **Auto-space before pasted file paths**: When pasting a file path (starting with `/`, `~`, or `.`) and the cursor is after a word character, a space is automatically prepended for better readability. Useful when dragging screenshots from macOS. ([#307](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/307) by [@mitsuhiko](https://github.com/mitsuhiko))
- **Word navigation for Input component**: Added Ctrl+Left/Right and Alt+Left/Right support for word-by-word cursor movement. ([#306](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/306) by [@kim0](https://github.com/kim0))
