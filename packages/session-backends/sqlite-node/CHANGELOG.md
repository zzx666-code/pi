### Added

- Added the composable, parameterized `sql` template tag for SQLite queries.

### Fixed

- Fixed SQLite branch queries to apply filters, cursors, and limits in SQL; bounded log reads; and added covering indexes for session, record, branch, and fact queries ([#7727](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/7727) by [@cristinaponcela](https://github.com/cristinaponcela)).

## [0.84.0] - 2026-08-06

### Breaking Changes

- Renamed the package from `@earendil-works/pi-storage-sqlite-node` to `@earendil-works/pi-session-backend-sqlite-node`.
- Replaced the legacy SQLite session schema and repository with the v4 lane-based `SessionRepo` contract. Existing work-in-progress databases are not migrated.

### Added

- Added bounded active-branch queries, durable operation records, global facts, shared sequence allocation, session statistics, and fenced writer leases to the SQLite backend.

### Fixed

- Fixed SQLite session listings to avoid acquiring writer claims and include current session names, allowing inventory reads while sessions have active writers ([#7655](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/7655)).
