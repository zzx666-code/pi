# Slash commands

Type `/` in Pi's terminal editor to search the commands available in the current session. This page lists the built-in commands in the current Pi release.

Extensions, prompt templates, and skills can add commands. The command menu in Pi is therefore the exact reference for the resources loaded in your session.

| `/thinking [level]` | Set the thinking level |

## Commands added by resources

- Extensions can register commands with their own arguments and completion behavior.
- Each prompt template is available under its template name.
- Skills are available as `/skill:name` when skill commands are enabled.

Use `/reload` after adding or changing a discovered command resource. See [Extensions](extensions.md), [Prompt Templates](prompt-templates.md), and [Skills](skills.md) for their loading and naming rules.
