# Chord implementation plan

> **Status:** Active implementation plan. Context, strict JSON, replicated state, service publication/consumption, the facet host/loader, and initial Node facet bundling and generation loading now live in Chord. Symmetric RPC and structural generation replacement remain planned. This is not a stable public API contract yet.

## 1. Goal

Chord will be the application-neutral foundation for:

1. loading, composing, unloading, reloading, and bundling plugins;
2. declaring and consuming local or remote services;
3. transporting service calls and subscriptions over symmetric RPC plumbing; and
4. replicating authoritative latest-value state to local and remote consumers.

The current Pi experiments prove many required behaviors, but Chord will be implemented from scratch. Existing source may be used as test and design evidence, not copied into this package. Compatibility with experimental APIs or wire messages is not a requirement.

## 2. Dependency boundary

The dependency direction is strict:

```text
@earendil-works/chord
        ↑
Pi agent, protocol, server, coding agent, TUI, and future applications
```

Chord must:

- have no dependency on another Pi workspace package;
- contain no imports from `@earendil-works/pi-*` or relative paths outside `packages/chord`;
- use application-neutral vocabulary in source, errors, tests, and examples;
- own any generic runtime types required by its public API, including strict JSON values and invocation cancellation context;
- keep Node-specific loading and bundling separate from the platform-neutral runtime; and
- be buildable, testable, packable, and usable without resolving another Pi package.

A generic third-party dependency is not prohibited, but each dependency must be justified. The runtime should initially prefer standard JavaScript APIs. The bundler may use one pinned implementation behind a Chord-owned adapter.

The following terms must not become Chord concepts: Session, Harness, AgentLane, server, client, attachment, TUI, model, tool, hook, provider credential, or workspace. Those belong to consumers.

## 3. Architectural model

### 3.1 Working vocabulary

The names below are provisional, but the distinctions are required.

- **Plugin**: one independently activated composition unit with a stable ID and synchronous setup function.
- **Plugin module**: a JavaScript module exporting one or more plugins for one application-selected entry.
- **Loaded generation**: plugins plus the resources owned by loading their module generation.
- **Host**: one assembled plugin and service graph.
- **Service token**: a stable runtime service ID plus type information and locality policy.
- **Provider**: the owner of one singleton service or one keyed service collection.
- **Connection**: a transport-neutral source of services outside the current host.
- **Peer**: one endpoint of a symmetric RPC channel. Either peer may provide and consume services.
- **Replicated state**: initialized immutable source revisions with read-only local or remote replicas.

A product feature may ship multiple plugin-module entries for different application environments. Chord does not group those entries into a cross-process runtime object and does not interpret their entry names.

### 3.2 Layering

The implementation should be divided into these layers:

```text
plugin loader and bundler
        ↓
plugin host, lifecycle, and dependency graph
        ↓
service tokens, providers, facades, and keyed instances
        ↓
replicated state and service subscriptions
        ↓
symmetric RPC peer and transport adapter
        ↓
strict JSON, invocation context, cancellation, and errors
```

The local service path must not require RPC serialization. The remote path must use the same service semantics through a strict wire boundary.

## 4. Invocation context and strict JSON

Current experiments depend on Pi's Harness `Context`, which Chord cannot import. Chord therefore needs a small neutral invocation context.

The initial context should provide:

- an optional `AbortSignal` for cancellation of one invocation or observation;
- immutable typed local values through Chord-owned context keys;
- a background root;
- child derivation, cancellation, and cancellation-aware waiting helpers; and
- no built-in telemetry, identity, authentication, or application values.

Applications may define their own context keys. A Pi adapter can carry telemetry and authenticated identity through such keys without Chord knowing their types.

A context object never crosses RPC as a business value. The calling peer sends cancellation control and, if configured, an opaque strict-JSON metadata carrier. The receiving adapter constructs a fresh local context. The adapter, not remote business arguments, installs authenticated local identity.

Chord owns the static `JsonValue` contract and provides `JsonRepresentation<T>` plus `isJsonValue()` for adapter boundaries. The service runtime deliberately performs no automatic recursive validation; concrete serializers remain responsible for rejecting unsupported values. Remote arguments, results, errors, snapshots, updates, catalogues, and RPC envelopes are expected to be finite strict JSON:

- finite numbers only;
- no `undefined`, sparse arrays, symbols, prototypes, cycles, classes, functions, `Map`, or `Set`; and
- `null`, rather than `undefined`, for business-level absence.

Application schema validation remains the application's responsibility. Chord validates structural control envelopes, but runtime enforcement of the strict-JSON boundary is currently deferred to serializers.

## 5. Plugins and lifecycle

### 5.1 Plugin shape

The intended author model is equivalent to:

```ts
interface Plugin {
  readonly id: string;
  setup(environment: PluginEnvironment): void;
}
```

Setup is synchronous declaration. It may:

- provide a singleton service;
- declare ownership of a keyed service;
- acquire a singleton service handle;
- declare an observation of keyed service instances;
- create replicated state;
- register an activation callback;
- register owned resource cleanup; and
- register final deactivation work.

Setup must not:

- invoke a service or read replicated state through an acquired facade;
- perform asynchronous work;
- introduce a new service dependency later from an event handler or activation callback; or
- mutate the active host generation.

The host records setup calls in a private generation ledger. Plugin authors do not maintain a parallel `requires`/`provides` manifest.

### 5.2 Assembly

After every plugin has completed setup, the host must:

1. collect local provisions and catalogues from configured remote service sources;
2. resolve every hard requirement to exactly one local or connected provision;
3. reject missing providers, duplicate providers, ambiguous source offers, and singleton/keyed mismatches;
4. reject duplicate plugin IDs;
5. derive provider-to-consumer lifecycle edges;
6. reject dependency cycles;
7. construct local and remote service bindings while handles are still inaccessible;
8. hydrate required connected services; and
9. activate providers before consumers.

A plugin may provide and consume the same token without creating a self-cycle. Optional dependencies are not part of the first contract; they require a distinct acquisition API later.

### 5.3 Resource ownership

Every plugin generation owns:

- activation callbacks;
- explicit cleanup functions;
- keyed instances added through its provider handle;
- keyed observations and their tasks; and
- service provisions.

Disposal is idempotent. Consumers deactivate before providers, and each plugin's resources dispose in reverse registration order. Cleanup continues after individual failures and reports one error or an `AggregateError` after all cleanup attempts finish.

Keyed observation handlers receive a fresh cancellable context. Closing or replacing the instance aborts only that handler task. A handler failure is reported through host policy unless its context was cancelled as normal cleanup.

### 5.4 Loaded module generations

Module loading and plugin activation are separate ownership domains:

```ts
interface LoadedPlugins {
  readonly plugins: readonly Plugin[];
  dispose(): Promise<void>;
}

interface PluginLoader {
  load(): Promise<LoadedPlugins>;
}
```

Required loaders:

- a static loader for built-ins and tests;
- an ordered combined loader with reverse disposal and startup-failure cleanup; and
- a bundle/module loader for one selected manifest entry.

The loader owns one source generation. The host owns active plugin lifecycles. A coordinator must deactivate a retired generation before disposing its `LoadedPlugins`.

Node's default ESM loader retains every imported module generation in its process-wide cache. Chord therefore bundles Node facets as CommonJS and compiles each generation directly with `node:vm`, without inserting plugin code into either Node module cache. Chord's unload contract remains deactivation, removal of service reachability, cleanup, and release of loader-owned references/resources. Once no plugin-created timer, listener, callback, or other escaped reference remains, V8 can garbage-collect the compiled generation; collection timing is not deterministic.

## 6. Loading, unloading, and reload

### 6.1 Host updates

Host updates are serialized and have two forms.

#### Shape-preserving replacement

A targeted replacement is shape-preserving when each replaced plugin keeps the same:

- plugin ID;
- required service IDs and modes;
- provided service IDs and modes; and
- remotely exposable singleton member names and kinds.

The sequence is:

```text
load replacement module generation
→ run replacement setup
→ validate replacement shape and remote implementations
→ activate replacements in dependency order while the old providers remain routed
→ replace each local or remote singleton directly without withdrawing it
→ deactivate replaced plugins in reverse dependency order
→ dispose the retired loaded generation
```

Properties:

- existing local and remote singleton facades keep object identity;
- captured local and remote methods dispatch to the old provider before cutover and the replacement after cutover;
- replicated-state facades install the replacement snapshot without becoming unhydrated;
- every singleton switches directly from its old target to its replacement, but a multi-service reload is not graph-transactional;
- keyed instances from the old plugin close; instances staged by the replacement use fresh generations;
- setup, shape-validation, or replacement-activation failure leaves the active generation unchanged;
- named host resources acquired during activation support overlapping staged replacements, so candidate cleanup restores the old registration and retired cleanup cannot remove the replacement; and
- any failure after replacement begins terminates the host rather than attempting to preserve a partially transitioned graph.

There is no rollback after cutover. Terminal cleanup revokes every facet handle before best-effort disposal; only pre-cutover candidate cleanup and ordinary host disposal guarantee dependency-ordered cleanup. Committed application effects are outside the reload transaction.

#### Structural replacement

Adding or removing plugins, changing service shape, or changing connection selection is structural. The first implementation should replace the complete host generation rather than attempt a partial affected-subgraph update:

```text
load and synchronously set up the complete desired generation
→ resolve and validate its graph without activation effects
→ begin cutover
→ withdraw old providers and deactivate the old graph
→ install and activate the new graph
→ dispose the old loaded generation
```

Rules:

- validation failure before cutover leaves the old graph active;
- after cutover starts, failure disposes the complete host because the retired graph cannot be restored;
- removing a provider while retaining a hard consumer is rejected during candidate validation;
- service facades owned outside plugin lifecycles remain stable when service ID and mode survive the replacement;
- removed services become permanently disconnected for the retired generation; and
- a future optimization may retain unaffected plugins, but it is not required for the initial structural update.

This full-generation path supplies actual plugin load and unload semantics without first implementing a complex partial-graph transaction.

### 6.2 Calls during unload

Replacement never leaves a singleton facade without a target: an invocation resolves either the old implementation or its replacement. Work already running in a retired facet is not drained; later use of that facet's revoked handles may fail as stale work. A future killable-isolate host terminates such work directly. Transport disconnect still cancels only connection-owned invocations; it does not imply application-level cancellation or rollback.

### 6.3 Update failure reporting

An update result must distinguish:

- load failure;
- setup or graph validation failure before cutover;
- old-generation deactivation failure;
- replacement activation failure;
- service rebinding failure; and
- retired loader disposal failure.

Multiple failures are aggregated without hiding the first transition failure. Concurrent update, unload, and host-dispose requests are serialized or rejected with a stable lifecycle error.

## 7. Services

### 7.1 Tokens and modes

A service token has:

- a non-empty stable string ID;
- a TypeScript contract type;
- a locality policy: remotely exposable by default or explicitly process-local; and
- no provider instance of its own.

Chord reserves a prefix for control-plane IDs. Duplicate IDs in one catalogue are invalid.

Two modes are required:

- **singleton**: one provider, many consumers; and
- **keyed**: one collection owner, dynamic instances, many observers.

One token has one mode in one host graph. Mixing singleton and keyed use is an assembly or protocol error.

### 7.2 Local services

Process-local services:

- may expose arbitrary objects, synchronous methods, classes, functions, native handles, or non-JSON values;
- are never included in a remote catalogue;
- use the same graph ordering, stable handles, keyed generations, and lifecycle behavior as remote services; and
- are trusted composition, not a security boundary.

A local singleton consumer receives a stable lazy facade, not the provider object. This removes setup-order dependence and lets provider replacement update captured methods.

Remotely exposable services use the provider/binding path even when provider and consumer share a host. An internal loopback binding keeps replacement, replicated-state, and keyed-generation semantics independent of placement. Only explicitly process-local services bypass that path.

### 7.3 Remote service contracts

A remotely exposable implementation may contain only own data properties classified as:

- asynchronous methods whose business arguments and result are strict JSON, with one Chord invocation context in the declared position; or
- branded replicated-state values.

The provider derives a runtime member table from the implementation. Plugin authors do not maintain a second method/state descriptor. Unsupported accessors, fields, or member kinds are rejected before publication.

Type-level checks should reject obviously invalid remote contracts. Runtime checks remain mandatory because types do not authenticate peers or survive JavaScript consumption.

Remote methods:

- return promises;
- return strict JSON or `void`;
- receive a fresh local invocation context;
- map caller cancellation to exactly one request;
- do not queue while disconnected; and
- expose stable error codes and sanitized messages across the wire.

Arbitrary returned object references, callbacks, function serialization, and general object-graph remoting are outside the initial scope.

### 7.4 Stable singleton facades

`use(token)` returns a facet-owned capability view over a source-independent host service slot. Repeated acquisition within one facet returns the same view; different facet lifecycles receive different views. Member slots are created lazily on property access and validated against provider metadata when bound.

Required behavior:

- inaccessible during setup and after the owning facet lifecycle ends;
- directly bound after local graph assembly or remote hydration;
- stable across provider withdrawal and replacement;
- method invocation fails while disconnected;
- state reads return `undefined` while unhydrated;
- a remotely exposable replacement preserves the complete member name/kind table; and
- a provider omitting an already-accessed member is a binding error.

### 7.5 Keyed services

`provideMany(token)` declares one keyed owner during setup and returns a generation-owned `ServiceSpawner`. While active, `spawn(key, implementation)`:

- requires a non-empty key unique among live instances;
- creates a host-owned monotonically increasing generation for that key;
- publishes methods and initial state atomically;
- returns an idempotent close function; and
- is automatically closed during plugin disposal.

An instance address is `(service ID, key, generation)`. Reusing a closed key creates a new generation. Stale facades cannot call the replacement.

`observe(token, handler)`:

- reconciles a complete initial instance directory;
- starts one task per instance only after all initial state members hydrate;
- preserves ordered additions, replacements, and removals;
- aborts the instance task on close, replacement, disconnect, or observation disposal;
- gives each observation an observer-lifetime service view that becomes inaccessible when its task is aborted; and
- never represents service facades inside replicated JSON state.

## 8. Replicated state

Replicated state is authoritative one-writer latest-value replication.

The source API has an initialized immutable value, `change(context, callback)`, `replace(context, value)`, and subscriptions. A remote or disconnected replica has `value === undefined` until hydration.

Required semantics:

1. The source is always initialized.
2. Source and replica values are strict JSON for remotely exposable state.
3. Subscribing to initialized local or hydrated replica state immediately delivers the current value with a fresh delivery context.
4. Subscribing to cold state registers without immediate delivery.
5. Subscription establishment installs update capture before taking the snapshot.
6. Updates racing the snapshot are buffered and delivered after the snapshot with no gap.
7. The source API exposes atomic copy-on-write transactions. A successful transaction publishes one decoded operation batch; a callback failure discards all tentative copies. Connection adapters encode each batch independently per client/state stream, and replicas apply batches only in sequence order.
8. A sequence gap clears readiness and triggers complete resubscription or reports a terminal binding error; stale state must not continue as current silently.
9. Disconnect, provider withdrawal, route change, and replacement clear replica readiness.
10. Reconnect or replacement installs a complete fresh snapshot in the existing state facade before later updates.
11. Listener exceptions are isolated and reported through host policy.
12. Values are immutable data. Chord returns raw immutable values for reads and listener delivery. Transaction drafts are revocable and assigned containers are copied by value; committed revisions structurally share unchanged subtrees.

State identity is structural:

```text
provider binding + service ID + optional keyed address + member name
```

There is no separate state ID.

Explicit non-goals:

- durability or reconstruction after process restart;
- event history;
- CRDT merging or multiple writers;
- offline mutation replay;
- high-frequency stream transport.

Chord exposes an intent-preserving JSON delta primitive and uses its operation batches internally for remote replicated state. Initial hydration and reconnection carry a complete root replacement. Producers mutate a transaction-scoped copy-on-write draft; Chord derives compact operations from the previous and next immutable revisions and uses a complete replacement when that is smaller. Replicated-state sources do not select reducers or interact with path encoders. Every client/state pairing owns an independent encoder, and sequence handling rejects gaps before a later operation can be applied.

## 9. Symmetric RPC plumbing

### 9.1 No client/server mode

Chord must not expose `Client`, `Server`, `SessionConnection`, or similar topology classes. It exposes a symmetric peer over an application-supplied duplex channel. Either endpoint may register handlers, provide services, call methods, or subscribe to state.

Application adapters own:

- sockets, pipes, WebSockets, workers, or loopback delivery;
- framing and reconnect policy;
- authentication and authorization;
- routing and target selection;
- process ownership;
- attachment or selection state; and
- application protocol envelopes surrounding a Chord message.

Chord sees one connected peer and already-decoded strict-JSON messages.

### 9.2 RPC layer

The generic RPC peer should own:

- request ID allocation scoped to one peer connection;
- request/response correlation;
- handler registration;
- cancellation frames and one request-local `AbortController`;
- disconnect rejection and cleanup;
- stable serializable error envelopes;
- ordered notification delivery;
- malformed-message rejection; and
- optional context metadata hooks.

The channel contract should be small: send one strict-JSON message, receive messages in order, observe close, and close. `send()` should be awaitable so adapters can provide backpressure.

A peer disconnect:

- rejects outbound requests;
- aborts inbound request contexts;
- closes service subscriptions and keyed observation tasks; and
- does not cancel application-owned jobs or perform durable business mutations.

### 9.3 Service protocol over RPC

The service layer adds transport-neutral operations for:

- catalogue discovery;
- singleton and keyed subscription open/close;
- complete subscription snapshots;
- method invocation;
- invocation cancellation;
- replicated-state updates;
- singleton unavailable/replaced events; and
- keyed instance spawned/closed events.

The wire protocol contains no server ID, session ID, attachment ID, route, user identity, or host kind. A Pi router may wrap or forward Chord envelopes using its own control fields without parsing service business payloads.

Provider catalogue and subscription state must come from actual service provisions, not a handwritten application inventory.

### 9.4 Wire errors and validation

Chord needs stable generic error codes for:

- service not allowed or absent;
- mode mismatch;
- member absent or used with the wrong kind;
- keyed instance absent or stale;
- invalid strict-JSON value;
- cancellation;
- malformed RPC message;
- peer disconnected; and
- internal provider failure.

Unexpected provider exceptions become a sanitized internal error by default. Stack traces and arbitrary exception fields do not cross the wire. Applications may register or map additional stable error codes through an adapter, but Chord does not own application error taxonomies.

### 9.5 Protocol evolution

The first implementation must version Chord's RPC/service envelope independently of any application protocol. Version negotiation can be a peer handshake or an adapter-guaranteed constructor parameter, but incompatible peers must fail before service calls are admitted.

Member and DTO compatibility across plugin-generation skew is an application responsibility. Chord guarantees only its generic envelope semantics.

## 10. Bundling

### 10.1 Purpose

The bundler turns one or more application-declared ESM or TypeScript plugin entries into independently loadable Node CommonJS artifacts. It is not a package manager or plugin registry.

Each entry is built independently. Chord does not assume names such as `server`, `session`, `tui`, or `web`; entry names are opaque application data.

### 10.2 Initial input and output

The initial bundler should accept:

- plugin identity and optional version metadata;
- a mapping of opaque entry names to TypeScript or JavaScript source files;
- an output directory;
- an application-supplied external-module allowlist;
- source-map and minification options; and
- optional define/platform settings needed for the Node CommonJS build.

The package-level API additionally accepts a plugin package directory, derives identity and version from `package.json`, applies application-supplied conventional entry paths when those files exist, and lets `chord.facets` override or disable conventions. Package discovery does not install dependencies or run lifecycle scripts.

It should emit:

- one content-addressed CommonJS file per entry;
- source maps when enabled;
- a versioned strict-JSON manifest;
- content hashes or integrity values;
- declared external imports; and
- enough metadata for diagnostics and fresh generation loads.

Writes should use a temporary output directory followed by an atomic rename so a loader never sees a half-written generation.

### 10.3 Bundle rules

- `@earendil-works/chord` must be externalized so a plugin uses the host's one runtime and branding symbols.
- Other dependencies are bundled by default. The explicit bundler API uses an application external allowlist; the package-level API also externalizes peer dependencies because the host provides them.
- Built-in module use may be allowed for Node entries but is not a trust or sandbox policy.
- Dynamic imports must be lowered through the loader's restricted `require`, and unresolved externals must be reported deterministically.
- Bundle output must not depend on Pi's repository path aliases.
- Rebuilding unchanged inputs should produce stable content except for documented metadata.
- Diagnostics must identify the entry and original source location.

The concrete bundler engine is an implementation detail. Select it with a spike covering TypeScript and ESM inputs, CommonJS output, source maps, externals, content hashing, and programmatic diagnostics before adding a dependency.

### 10.4 Bundle loading

The bundle loader must:

1. parse and validate the manifest;
2. select one application-requested entry;
3. verify integrity before activation when integrity is present;
4. compile it directly with `node:vm` as a fresh generation outside Node's module caches;
5. validate that its exports are plugins with unique non-empty IDs;
6. return `LoadedPlugins`; and
7. provide idempotent loader disposal.

Plugin discovery, installation, version resolution, download, signature trust, and update policy remain application responsibilities.

## 11. Pi migration boundary

The following existing files describe behavior that should become Chord responsibility through a rewrite:

| Existing area | Chord responsibility |
|---|---|
| `packages/agent/src/plugins/services/types.ts` | service tokens, modes, remote contract checks, strict JSON, snapshots, updates, connection interfaces |
| `packages/agent/src/plugins/services/replicated-state.ts` | authoritative replicated state and delivery semantics |
| `packages/agent/src/plugins/services/provider.ts` | provider classification, calls, singleton replacement, keyed generations, snapshots |
| `packages/agent/src/plugins/services/namespace.ts` | stable remote facades, hydration, state updates, keyed observation |
| `packages/coding-agent/src/experimental/facets.ts` | plugin environment, dependency ledger, lifecycle graph, host, reload |
| `packages/coding-agent/src/experimental/facet-loader.ts` | static and combined loaders plus loaded-generation ownership |
| generic service sections of `packages/protocol/src/protocol.ts` | Chord-owned versioned service/RPC envelope |

The following must remain outside Chord:

| Existing area | Downstream responsibility |
|---|---|
| `packages/coding-agent/src/experimental/services/connection.ts` | Pi connection state, selected-session attachment, route rebinding, Pi client adapter |
| `packages/coding-agent/src/experimental/services/server.ts` | server-wide session directory and management implementations |
| `packages/coding-agent/src/experimental/services/worker.ts` | Session worker host construction and Pi protocol publication adapter |
| `packages/server`, `packages/client`, and process managers | framing, routing, authentication, attachment, process lifecycle, reconnect policy |
| slash-command, model, account, transcript, TUI, and agent-controller services | application contracts and plugin implementations |
| `source-resolver.ts` and Pi internal process entrypoints | Pi source execution and process policy |

The Pico5 Chord usage guide, experimental service tests, and remote plugin fixture are behavioral input. They are not normative Chord APIs. Once migration finishes, generic semantics should be documented in Chord and Pi documents should cover only their host-specific contracts and adapters.

Migration should happen only after Chord passes its standalone conformance suite:

1. implement Chord without changing Pi callers;
2. add thin Pi adapters and migrate generic service imports;
3. migrate the experimental plugin host and loaders;
4. adapt Pi's routed protocol to carry Chord envelopes;
5. run local, loopback, framed, keyed-generation, reload, and TUI integration tests; and
6. delete duplicate experimental generic implementations only after all consumers use Chord.

No compatibility shim is required unless separately requested.

If Node-only APIs are exported, they should use a separate package export such as `@earendil-works/chord/node` or `@earendil-works/chord/bundler`; importing the main runtime must not load Node-only modules.

- bundler-engine spike and decision;
- programmatic bundler API;
- versioned manifest;
- independent content-addressed entries;
- source maps and diagnostics;
- Chord externalization;
- atomic output replacement;
- manifest/integrity validation; and
- fresh VM-compiled generation loading outside Node's module caches.

Tests bundle an application-neutral fixture with two opaque entries and a third-party dependency, load each independently, activate it, reload changed source, prove unchanged source hashes are stable, reject corrupt manifests/integrity, and prove output resolves no Pi packages.

### WP8 — Pi adoption

This work is downstream of Chord rather than an implementation dependency.

Deliver:

- Pi adapters for context metadata and routed RPC transport;
- migration of experimental service and plugin host consumers;
- preservation of selected-session and TUI behavior outside Chord;
- framed integration and reload coverage; and
- removal of superseded generic experimental code.

Exit condition: Pi depends on Chord, while Chord remains independently packable and contains no Pi imports.

## 14. Required conformance matrix

The standalone suite must cover at least:

### Plugin graph and lifecycle

- declaration only during setup;
- setup service access rejection;
- deterministic graph ordering;
- missing, duplicate, ambiguous, and cyclic dependencies;
- activation and reverse disposal;
- startup and disposal failure aggregation;
- local and connected providers in one graph;
- complete structural load/unload; and
- shape-preserving reload.

### Services

- singleton and keyed modes;
- unrestricted local contracts;
- remote member classification;
- strict JSON and `void` results;
- stable local and remote facades;
- provider withdrawal and replacement;
- keyed generation fencing;
- per-call cancellation; and
- connection and host access guards.

### Replication

- initialized source and cold replica;
- immediate hydrated subscription delivery;
- snapshot/update race freedom;
- ordered updates and gap handling;
- disconnect clearing;
- replacement and reconnect rehydration;
- keyed state before observer startup; and
- listener/handler cleanup.

### RPC

- symmetric calls in both directions;
- request correlation and cancellation isolation;
- malformed and oversized-message policy;
- sanitized errors;
- disconnect cleanup;
- subscription cleanup;
- protocol-version mismatch; and
- deterministic in-memory and framed-adapter tests.

### Loading and bundling

- loader order and reverse disposal;
- fresh generation evaluation and garbage-collection eligibility;
- manifest validation and integrity;
- independent entries;
- dependency bundling and explicit externals;
- source maps and diagnostics;
- atomic output; and
- packed-package execution outside the monorepo.

Race tests should control exact points rather than use timing: subscription capture versus state update, request admission versus cancellation, provider withdrawal versus invocation, instance close versus call, reload cutover versus update publication, and host dispose versus activation.

## 15. Non-goals for the initial implementation

- Pi host APIs or built-in Pi services;
- plugin discovery, installation, download, registry, or package resolution;
- trust policy, code signing, sandboxing, or capability security;
- network listeners, socket framing, reconnect loops, routing, or authentication;
- server/client roles or fixed process topologies;
- durable state, database integration, migrations, or transactional application writes;
- CRDTs, offline writes, or mutation replay;
- arbitrary object remoting, callbacks, remote references, or garbage collection of references;
- serialized UI trees, remote tools, or remote hooks;
- generic contribution registries; applications can expose these as process-local services;
- automatic retries of mutating calls after uncertain disconnects; and
- backward compatibility with experimental Pi APIs or wire formats.

## 16. Decisions required before implementation

The following decisions should be recorded in this document or small ADRs before WP1/WP2/WP7 begins:

1. Final public names: `Plugin` versus `Facet`, `Host`, `Peer`, and `Connection`.
2. The exact neutral context API and remote method context position.
3. Whether context metadata propagation is in the first RPC envelope or added with a compatible optional field.
4. Wait-versus-cancel policy for admitted provider calls during unload.
5. Peer protocol negotiation and maximum message-size ownership.
6. State sequence-gap recovery: automatic resubscribe versus terminal binding failure.
7. Bundler engine and its runtime/development dependency placement.
8. Manifest schema, integrity algorithm, and external-module resolution contract.
9. Whether browser-compatible core behavior is an immediate tested requirement or only an architectural constraint.

None of these decisions should introduce Pi concepts into Chord.

## 17. Definition of done

Chord's initial scope is complete when:

- a standalone application unrelated to Pi can define local and remote singleton/keyed services;
- two symmetric peers can call each other, cancel calls, subscribe, disconnect, and rehydrate;
- replicated state satisfies the snapshot/update and replacement semantics above;
- plugins activate from a validated graph and own all registered resources;
- a running host can load, unload, structurally replace, and shape-preservingly reload plugin generations;
- stable service facades survive provider replacement as specified;
- the Node bundler emits and reloads independent content-addressed plugin entries;
- all race and lifecycle conformance tests pass;
- the packed package works outside the Pi monorepo; and
- an automated boundary check proves that Chord has no imports or dependencies on the rest of Pi.
