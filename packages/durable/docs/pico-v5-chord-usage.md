# Pico5 documents through Chord

This guide uses the contracts in the [Pico5 specification](pico-v5.md).

- **Session:** a durable container for conversations, entries, tasks, and documents;
  it serializes mutations on one commit line.
- **Facet:** a feature's setup unit in a Chord host. Setup declares services and
  dependencies synchronously; `onActivate` runs after dependencies are ready.
- **Context:** explicitly passed cancellation and invocation values. Forward the caller's context.
- **Service:** a typed token and implementation acquired with `env.use`. Remote
  services contain replicated state and async methods with JSON arguments plus a trailing `Context`.
- **Durable document:** JSON persisted as a complete base, Chord operations, and
  checkpoints. Its definition token declares schema, version, scope, and initialization;
  conversation scope also declares history and fork behavior.
- **Transaction draft:** the revocable copy-on-write object from `await tx.doc`,
  valid only inside that commit callback, including all nested objects.
- **DocumentSource:** an opaque handle to one document incarnation's committed changes,
  not a mutable value or a public subscription API.
- **ReplicatedState:** Chord's immutable complete values through `value` and
  `subscribe(listener)`. `value` is `undefined` before hydration or while disconnected.
  The listener receives `(value, context, delivery)`; delivery contains `kind`
  (`hydrate` or `update`) and a stream `sequence`, not a Session commit number.

Documents are scoped directly to a Session, conversation, or task. A task is
durable work attached to a conversation; its documents retire when it becomes
terminal and never participate in conversation forks.

## Imports and the adapter boundary

Examples build on one another. Pico5 names (`defineDoc`, `defineDocFamily`,
`Session`, `DocumentSource`, `Id`, `TaskRuntime`, `DocumentObserver`)
refer to normative contracts, without a specified import path or runnable Pico5
package. In those contracts, `ConversationRecord`, `EntryRecord`, and
`TaskRecord` are persisted records, while `Conversation` is the public
conversation object and `Entry`/`Task` are typed definitions. The Chord imports
below are the concrete APIs used by the examples:

```ts
import {
  createFacetHost, createRemoteServiceBinding, defineFacet, defineService,
  replicatedState,
  type Context, type Facet, type JsonValue, type RemoteServiceTransport,
  type ReplicatedState,
} from "@earendil-works/chord";
import { BACKGROUND_CONTEXT } from "@earendil-works/chord/context";
import { applyImmutable } from "@earendil-works/chord/delta";

// The Pico specification calls this object-root constraint JsonObject.
type JsonObject = { [key: string]: JsonValue };
```

Chord adoption atomically captures a committed snapshot, buffers every later
source frame, installs the frame listener, and drains the buffer before returning.
Operations already reflected in the snapshot are never redelivered. It forwards
committed values and operations without another tracker or re-diff. Disposing the
adopted state releases observation, not the document. A source-backed state is
publication-only; Pico remains the sole mutator. Even hydration must never prepare
or publish an uncommitted draft.

## 1. A Session-wide canvas

All conversations in this Session share one canvas. Session documents are
current-only and have no history or fork settings.

```ts
type Stroke = { color: string; points: { x: number; y: number }[] };
type CanvasState = { strokes: Stroke[] };

const CanvasDoc = defineDoc<CanvasState>({
  kind: "app.canvas", version: 1, scope: "session",
  initial: () => ({ strokes: [] }),
  // This append-only example adds one stroke per commit.
  checkpointWhen: value => value.strokes.length % 100 === 0,
});

interface CanvasService {
  readonly state: ReplicatedState<CanvasState | null>;
  addStroke(stroke: Stroke, context: Context): Promise<void>;
}
const Canvas = defineService<CanvasService>("app.canvas");

async function createCanvasFacet(session: Session, context: Context): Promise<Facet> {
  // Creation is explicit; observation never writes.
  await session.commit(async tx => {
    await tx.doc(CanvasDoc);
  }, context);
  const source = await session.documentSource(CanvasDoc, context);
  if (source === undefined) throw new Error("canvas was retired during setup");
  return defineFacet({
    id: "app.canvas/session",
    setup(env) {
      const state = replicatedState(source);
      env.own(() => state.dispose());
      env.provide(Canvas, {
        state,
        async addStroke(stroke, context) {
          await session.commit(async tx => {
            const draft = await tx.doc(CanvasDoc);
            draft.strokes.push(stroke); // Chord copies the assigned stroke by value.
          }, context);
        },
      });
    },
  });
}

const CanvasConsumer = defineFacet({
  id: "app.canvas/consumer",
  setup(env) {
    const canvas = env.use(Canvas); // Declare now; access only after activation.
    env.onActivate(() => {
      env.own(canvas.state.subscribe((value, _context, delivery) => {
        console.log(delivery.kind, delivery.sequence, value?.strokes.length ?? "retired");
      })); // subscribe delivers the current hydrated value, then updates.
    });
  },
});

async function runCanvasExample(session: Session): Promise<void> {
  const context = BACKGROUND_CONTEXT;
  const provider = await createCanvasFacet(session, context);
  const host = await createFacetHost({ facets: [provider, CanvasConsumer] });
  try {
    await host.services.use(Canvas).addStroke({
      color: "black", points: [{ x: 10, y: 20 }, { x: 30, y: 40 }],
    }, context);
  } finally {
    await host.dispose(); // Unsubscribes; does not delete the canvas or close Session.
  }
}
```

The application owns the open Session. Acquire the document source
asynchronously before synchronous `setup`, then adopt it synchronously during
`setup`; `env.provide` cannot run in `onActivate`. Install one provider per
Session host. Chord may reload presentation facets independently, but v1 does
not use facet reload to replace Session-side task or hook implementations. A
host extension code change closes and reopens the Harness with the new
definition set.

Remote clients supply a `RemoteServiceTransport` connected to the host's `services`
provider; Chord prescribes no socket protocol. `CanvasConsumer` also works unchanged
in a UI host configured with a remote service source.

```ts
async function connectCanvas(transport: RemoteServiceTransport, context: Context) {
  const services = createRemoteServiceBinding({ services: [Canvas], transport });
  const canvas = services.use(Canvas);
  const stop = canvas.state.subscribe((value, _context, delivery) => {
    console.log(delivery.kind, delivery.sequence, value?.strokes ?? "retired");
  });
  try {
    await services.ready(context); // Initial snapshot installed; not all future updates.
  } catch (error) {
    stop();
    await services.dispose(BACKGROUND_CONTEXT);
    throw error;
  }
  return async () => {
    stop();
    await services.dispose(BACKGROUND_CONTEXT);
  };
}
```

```text
explicit first tx.doc -> commit base { strokes: [] }
addStroke(A)       -> commit A -> local and remote subscribers see A
worker restarts   -> open same durable storage; install canvas facet again
acquire source    -> load base + committed deltas, without rerunning initial()
late client       -> hydrate complete canvas including A, then ordered updates
conversation fork -> still uses this same Session canvas
```

Use persistent storage for restart survival. The memory backend is not persistent.
A method's successful commit does not promise every remote callback has run yet.

## 2. Conversation-scoped diff reviews

A **document family** uses one definition for many instances. The logical key is
`(kind, conversationId, key)`; the persisted numeric document ID identifies an
incarnation and is never reused. The creation seed is not part of the key.

```ts
type ReviewInput = { path: string; patch: string };
type ReviewComment = { id: string; line: number; text: string };
type ReviewState = ReviewInput & { comments: ReviewComment[] };
const ReviewDoc = defineDocFamily<ReviewState, ReviewInput>({
  kind: "app.diff-review", version: 1, family: true, scope: "conversation",
  history: "latest", fork: "current",
  initial: seed => ({ path: seed.path, patch: seed.patch, comments: [] }),
  checkpointWhen: value => value.comments.length % 50 === 0,
});
interface DiffReviewService {
  readonly state: ReplicatedState<ReviewState | null>;
  identity(context: Context): Promise<{ conversationId: Id; key: string }>;
  addComment(comment: ReviewComment, context: Context): Promise<void>;
}
const DiffReviews = defineService<DiffReviewService>("app.diff-reviews");

function reviewFacet(
  session: Session, conversationId: Id,
  reviews: readonly { key: string; seed: ReviewInput }[], context: Context,
): Facet {
  return defineFacet({
    id: "app.diff-reviews/session",
    setup(env) {
      const instances = env.provideMany(DiffReviews);
      env.onActivate(async () => {
        for (const review of reviews) {
          await session.commit(async tx => {
            await tx.doc(ReviewDoc, conversationId, review.key, review.seed);
          }, context);
          const source = await session.documentSource(ReviewDoc, conversationId, review.key, context);
          if (source === undefined) throw new Error("review was retired during setup");
          const state = replicatedState(source);
          env.own(() => state.dispose());
          // Chord instance keys route services; they are not numeric document incarnation IDs.
          instances.spawn(JSON.stringify([conversationId, review.key]), {
            state,
            async identity() { return { conversationId, key: review.key }; },
            async addComment(comment, context) {
              await session.commit(async tx => {
                const draft = await tx.doc(ReviewDoc, conversationId, review.key, review.seed);
                draft.comments.push(comment); // Chord copies the assigned comment by value.
              }, context);
            },
          }); // The facet owns spawned service lifetimes automatically.
        }
      });
    },
  });
}
```

Example input: `[{ key: "review-7", seed: { path: "a.ts", patch: "-old\n+new" } }]`.
Pass distinct family keys and a real conversation ID; install the facet as above.
Keyed consumers use `env.observe(DiffReviews, handler)`, not `env.use`. The handler
receives `(review, context)`; call `review.identity(context)` to identify it and
`review.state.subscribe` to observe comments.

These comments are conversation-scoped: ending the generating task or unloading
the facet does not retire them. `current` copies every logically
present review at fork-commit time into independent child instances with new
numeric IDs, retaining family keys. Parent and child then diverge.

```text
parent review-7: comment A -> transcript entry E -> comment B
fork at E with current: child review-7 contains A and B
child adds C: parent still contains only A and B
```

With `fork: "initial"`, no instance copies; the first child `tx.doc()` uses its supplied seed.
`latest` cannot read history or fork `asOf`; use `history: "rewindable"` with `asOf`
to reflect E's commit. Reaccess ignores later seeds; updating the patch requires
an explicit mutation or a distinct review key.

## 3. Task-scoped output and a tool/task watch

This is a bounded progress window, not the permanent result. Scope itself gives
it task lifetime; no history, fork, owner, or conversation setting is needed.

```ts
type JobInput = { command: string };
type JobOutput = { stdout: string; chunks: number };
const JobOutputDoc = defineDoc<JobOutput>({
  kind: "app.job-output", version: 1, scope: "task",
  initial: () => ({ stdout: "", chunks: 0 }),
  checkpointWhen: value => value.chunks % 100 === 0,
});
async function appendJobOutput(
  runtime: TaskRuntime<JobInput, { phase: "running" }, null, {}>,
  chunk: string, context: Context,
): Promise<void> {
  // Read process output outside this callback. The runtime gates the live task.
  await runtime.commit(async tx => {
    const draft = await tx.doc(JobOutputDoc, runtime.taskId);
    draft.stdout = (draft.stdout + chunk).slice(-50_000);
    draft.chunks += 1;
  }, context);
}
async function observeJob(
  api: DocumentObserver, producerTaskId: Id,
  finished: Promise<void>, context: Context,
): Promise<void> {
  const watch = await api.watchDoc(JobOutputDoc, producerTaskId, context);
  if (watch === undefined) return;
  let value = watch.value;
  console.log(value === null ? "retired" : value.stdout);
  try {
    watch.start(async (ops, _context) => {
      value = applyImmutable(value, ops);
      await render(value === null ? "retired" : value.stdout);
    }); // Serialized callbacks never overlap.
    await finished; // Caller-supplied observation lifetime; outside any commit.
  } finally {
    watch.stop(); // Idempotent; prevents another callback from starting.
    await watch.closed; // Wait for an in-flight callback to settle.
  }
}
```

The running phase calls `appendJobOutput` and must also commit its next checkpoint
or terminal outcome. `api` is the invocation's `DocumentObserver`; `TaskRuntime`
includes that interface. `tx.doc()` creation validates that the target task is live and derives its
conversation from the task record. A later non-creating watch lookup returns
`undefined` after the task is terminal and its document has retired.

```text
watchDoc: capture immutable V0 + register for later committed operation batches
producer commits D1 and D2 before start: queue D1, D2
pending operation count exceeds its limit: replace suffix with [["r", V2]]
start: caller has initialized from V0; deliver the reset through the async listener
producer commits D3 while listener awaits: queue D3; never overlap callbacks
unrelated commit has no source ops: enqueue nothing
producer becomes terminal: queue [["r", null]], deliver it, then close as retired
```

Watches automatically stop when their invocation ends. A Session-acquired watch
is caller-owned and stops on Session close. Previously delivered snapshots never
mutate. Slow or unstarted delivery may coalesce an undelivered suffix into a
complete reset, so a watch is convergent state observation rather than a
transition journal. Retirement ends the incarnation's stream; a service exposing that source must
withdraw or remain terminal at `null`. Recreation requires a new watch/source,
service attachment, and numeric document ID. A terminal task cannot
create more output. Task-scoped documents
never copy into forks. Preserve required output in result entries or Session- or
conversation-scoped documents in the terminal commit before retirement. Use a
task-scoped family only when one task needs several independently keyed documents.

## 4. Built-in conversation views and commit delivery

`ConversationView` contains `conversation`, raw transcript `entries`, and
`docs: Readonly<Record<string, JsonObject>>`. Selected built-in singletons mount
under `docs` by stable document kind, not numeric incarnation ID. The spec's
illustrative path mapping is:

```text
document ["s", ["message"], value]
 -> view ["s", ["docs", "pi.live", "message"], value]
```

Built-in kinds and fields await approval; `pi.live` is illustrative, not an available API.
The mount publishes one batch per complete Session commit: entry/head changes and
changed mounted documents together, without a tracker or semantic projection.
Third-party documents are **not automatically mounted**; use their own Chord
services or trusted invocation watches. A retired source publishes `null`; a
dynamic service should then withdraw its instance rather than expose stale data.

```text
addStroke -> hold Session mutation line -> await tx.doc -> mutate tracker change draft
callback succeeds -> tracker prepare: immutable candidate + frozen ops
Session checkpoint predicate selects a base or delta exactly once
atomic storage commit: persist selected document and record writes
storage succeeds -> adopt candidate + enqueue candidate/ops, still on line
release line -> deliver committed source ops -> adapter -> local/remote Chord consumers
late subscriber -> atomically capture committed value + adapter sequence + subscription
```

No visible-undurable path exists. Callback, tracker preparation, and checkpoint
failure abort normally before Storage admission. An uncertain Storage failure
publishes nothing and poisons the open Session; close and reopen it instead of
continuing.

## Footguns

- Never retain drafts, nested proxies, or bound array methods across commits;
  they are revoked. Assigned containers are copied by value.
- Async commit holds the line through storage settlement and baseline adoption.
  Await document access there, not models, processes, network calls, or humans.
- Only `tx.doc()` creates. `snapshot`, `documentSource`, and `watchDoc` return
  `undefined` when absent and never write. Family seeds are used only when the
  first `tx.doc()` creates an incarnation; later seeds are ignored.
- Initialize from the fixed `watch.value` before `start()`. Slow or unstarted
  delivery may coalesce an undelivered suffix into a root replacement when its
  operation count exceeds the limit, omitting intermediate states. Queue
  accounting never serializes operations to estimate bytes. Do not use a watch
  as an audit log.
- A listener may call `stop()`, but must not await its own `closed` promise.
- Definitions own checkpoints, not storage heuristics. Revise the counting predicates
  above if mutations change. Keep document kinds, versions, fork policies, and
  public paths stable; schema changes require migration, not a source-only rename.
